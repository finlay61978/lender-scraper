credit commitments and the total rent received keyed as 'Rental Income (if rental property). Dependants expandable section A dependant is anyone who is financially reliant on your customer, who is not a party to the mortgage and does not contribute to the mortgage payments. A dependant may be a child, spouse not party to the mortgage, adult or elderly relative or a future dependant. You need to capture separately both Child and Adult Dependants. Child Dependant A child dependant would include any children for which the customer(s) is the primary carer and who is under 18. A child dependant would include a future dependant where the customer is expecting a baby or is in the process of adopting a child. Foster children should be included as dependants. Where any children have income and can fully support themselves they do not need to be keyed as a dependant. If a child is not living with the customer(s) and maintenance is being paid, a dependant does not need to be keyed, but the maintenance amount must be keyed as a commitment. Adult Dependant An adult dependant is someone who is not party to the mortgage but is financially reliant on the customer. This could be a spouse/partner, elderly relative or grown up children who are unemployed or in full time education. Where the adult dependant resides at the property for some of the time, you would key this in the adult dependant field. Alternatively, where the customer financially supports an adult dependant who doesn't reside at the property, they would not be keyed as a dependant, but the related costs instead must be keyed as a total figure in “Other Commitments”.

Forces Help to Buy (previously called Long Service Advance of pay) Serving members of HM Forces may be able to raise capital for a deposit by means of a 'Forces Help to Buy' (FHTB) interest free loan which will be repaid by the customer through their pay. This can be accepted as a deposit for a mortgage on a main residence or when using the Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme and the repayment must be keyed as a commitment. FHTBs are repayable interest free over 10 years so to calculate the monthly payment, divide the amount borrowed under the FHTB scheme by 120. Where the deposit is funded from FHTB, the deposit type should be keyed as savings. The applicant will not receive confirmation of the FHTB amount from HM Forces until they have received their mortgage offer, so there is no requirement to obtain evidence. Concessionary If the deposit is from equity (e.g. a reduced purchase price) the application should be treated as a concessionary purchase - refer to CONCESSIONARY PURCHASE FOR CRITERIA. Vendor Deposits and Cashbacks (Non New Build Properties) Vendor Gifted Deposits are an unacceptable source of deposit for any non new build property.

First Monthly Payment & Initial Interest expandable section The first monthly payment is always collected in the month following completion, for example if a mortgage completes in June the first payment will be collected in July. This will be collected on the customer’s chosen monthly payment date unless completion occurs in the last few days of any month and results in less than 4 working days between the completion date and the customer's chosen payment date (excluding those days), the first payment will then be collected on the 10th of that month. This date will then revert to the customer's chosen payment date on the following month. The first monthly payment includes an amount of ‘Initial Interest’ from the day of completion to the end of that month plus the first monthly mortgage payment. For example: If completion occurs on the 15th, interest is calculated from the 15th to the end of the month and then added to the first payment If completion occurs on the 5th, interest is calculated from the 5th to the end of the month and then added to the first payment The 'Amount of each instalment' section of the mortgage illustration sets out a first payment assuming a mortgage completes on the 1st of the following month. A customer’s first monthly payment may be different as it will depend on when the loan starts. We write to all customers when the mortgage starts to tell them when we will collect their first and subsequent payments.

Interest Only expandable section The maximum loan amount available on interest only is 75% loan to value (LTV) (or for sale of mortgaged property (SOMP) main residence 50%, 60% or 75% depending on the minimum equity requirement). On part interest only/part capital and interest repayment customers can borrow up to 85% LTV with the balance on capital and interest repayment. Check the maximum loan on interest only for all repayment plans, including Sale of Mortgaged Property (SOMP) repayment plans, using the interest only calculator. All loans arranged where the capital element is not included in the monthly payment, including those that are part capital and interest repayment, part interest only, must have a plan in place to repay the capital at the end of the term. This includes new loans, further advances and product transfers. As a responsible lender, it is important for us to see evidence of the repayment plan for interest only mortgages so documents relating to the repayment plan must be received before a new mortgage offer can be considered. The repayment plan must cover the whole amount of interest only. This information is only a guide. A mortgage offer will only be issued once we have confirmed that the evidence supplied meets our criteria. Bonus There is a minimum income requirement for this repayment plan to be available: Sole applicant with an income of £75,000 or more Joint applicants where one applicant has an income of £75,000 or more, or where the combined income of both applicants is £100,000 or more. e.g. this could be £60k and £40k, therefore no applicant has an income of £75,000 or more but together their income is £100,000 or more The income requirement is calculated on the total of Basic, Overtime, Bonus and Commission for employed applicants or the latest year's income for self-employed customers. The amount of this repayment vehicle which can be used is assessed by: An annual bonus figure is calculated from the payslips provided as evidence Where bonus is paid annually the average of the bonus received in the last 2 years is used 30% of this bonus figure is then multiplied by the term of the mortgage required for the amount of Interest Only lending available There is an expectation that the customer will make periodic lump sum repayments to reduce the amount outstanding during their Interest Only mortgage and it is important the customer understands this,

Endowment There is a minimum income requirement for this repayment plan to be available: Sole or joint applicants have a combined income of £50,000 or more The income requirement is calculated on the total of Basic, Overtime, Bonus and Commission for employed applicants or the latest year's income for self-employed customers.

The term can run up to 364 days past the lower of the ARA / MWA of 70.

Important points on the assessment: We are not providing advice on your customer's repayment plan(s) or making any guarantee that their plan(s) will be sufficient to repay the outstanding balance (capital) at the end of the mortgage term. Your customer should review their plan(s) regularly during the term of their mortgage to make sure it is on track to repay the outstanding balance. Periodically, we will ask your customer to provide evidence of their repayment plan(s). If your customer is unable to satisfy us that their repayment plan(s) remains on track to repay the outstanding balance on their mortgage, we may ask your customer to transfer some or all of their mortgage onto a capital and interest repayment basis. Please remember it is your customer's responsibility to ensure they have sufficient funds to repay their outstanding balance at the end of the mortgage term. If they are unable to do so, their home may be repossessed to repay the outstanding balance. Important points on repayment plans: Repayment plans CANNOT be accepted if they include the name of anyone NOT named on the mortgage. Your customer can use more than one repayment plan to cover their total interest only amount. In this case, please send the relevant evidence for all repayment plans. The following are NOT acceptable repayment plans: Sale of other commercial property. Sale of non property assets. Inheritance. Maturity dates will be requested for each applicable repayment plan The mortgage term must finish before a maximum age of 70 years rather than 80 years for repayment mortgages. For pension and bonus repayment plan types the maximum term would be restricted further if there

was a lower anticipated retirement age. Only repayment vehicles for those customers intending to live at the mortgaged property may be used to support the loan. E.G. if a parent is named on the mortgage to help with affordability then a property in the parents name cannot be accepted as a repayment vehicle. Existing Halifax mortgage customers moving home If an existing customer does not meet the current interest only rules we may consider allowing interest only on the new mortgage up to the level held currently, provided the mortgage term is not increasing. Please refer to your BDM for guidance. Interest Only expandable section The maximum loan amount available on interest only is 75% loan to value (LTV) (or for sale of mortgaged property (SOMP) main residence 50%, 60% or 75% depending on the minimum equity requirement). On part interest only/part capital and interest repayment customers can borrow up to 85% LTV with the balance on capital and interest repayment. Check the maximum loan on interest only for all repayment plans, including Sale of Mortgaged Property (SOMP) repayment plans, using the interest only calculator. All loans arranged where the capital element is not included in the monthly payment, including those that are part capital and interest repayment, part interest only, must have a plan in place to repay the capital at the end of the term. This includes new loans, further advances and product transfers. As a responsible lender, it is important for us to see evidence of the repayment plan for interest only mortgages so documents relating to the repayment plan must be received before a new mortgage offer can be considered. The repayment plan must cover the whole amount of interest only. This information is only a guide. A mortgage offer will only be issued once we have confirmed that the evidence supplied meets our criteria. Bonus There is a minimum income requirement for this repayment plan to be available: Sole applicant with an income of £75,000 or more Joint applicants where one applicant has an income of £75,000 or more, or where the combined income of both applicants is £100,000 or more. e.g. this could be £60k and £40k, therefore no applicant has an income of £75,000 or more but together their income is £100,000 or more The income requirement is calculated on the total of Basic, Overtime, Bonus and Commission for employed applicants or the latest year's income for self-employed customers. The amount of this repayment vehicle which can be used is assessed by: An annual bonus figure is calculated from the payslips provided as evidence Where bonus is paid annually the average of the bonus received in the last 2 years is used 30% of this bonus figure is then multiplied by the term of the mortgage required for the amount of Interest Only lending available There is an expectation that the customer will make periodic lump sum repayments to reduce the amount outstanding during their Interest Only mortgage and it is important the

--- CHUNK 15 ---
customer understands this, however Early Repayment Charges would apply as normal where any overpayment concession is exceeded Where any Bonus is to be used as a repayment plan no bonus income earned by any customer will be used in the affordability assessment Lending Into Retirement - the term of any Interest Only lending must not exceed the lower of the Anticipated Retirement Age or Maximum Working Age of 70 where Bonus is being used as a Repayment Plan. The term can run up to 364 days past the lower of the ARA / MWA of 70. Evidence of bonus income is required: If received monthly the latest 3 payslips.

The amount of this repayment vehicle which can be used is assessed by: Copy of statement dated within last month and a previous statement showing Cash amount held for a minimum of 3 consecutive months If a minimum £50,000 has been held in a savings or current account (£ sterling) for a minimum 3 consecutive months 100% of the current cash balance can be used to support Interest Only lending If the statements show a fluctuating cash balance then the lowest balance will be used If savings are also being used as source of deposit then evidence of an amount sufficient for both the repayment plan and deposit must be provided Lending Into Retirement – the term of any Interest Only lending must not exceed the Maximum Working Age of 70 where Cash is being used as a Repayment Plan. Endowment There is a minimum income requirement for this repayment plan to be available: Sole or joint applicants have a combined income of £50,000 or more The income requirement is calculated on the total of Basic, Overtime, Bonus and Commission for employed applicants or the latest year's income for self-employed customers.

The term can run up to 364 days past the lower of the ARA / MWA of 70. Sale of mortgaged property Check the maximum loan on Sale of Mortgaged Property (SOMP) repayment plans, using the interest only calculator. There is a minimum income requirement for this repayment plan to be available: Sole applicant with an income of £75,000 or more Joint applicants where one applicant has an income of £75,000 or more, or where the combined income of both applicants is £100,000 or more. e.g. this could be £60k and £40k, therefore no applicant has an income of £75,000 or more but together their income is £100,000 or more The income requirement is calculated on the total of Basic, Overtime, Bonus and Commission for employed applicants or the latest year's income for self-employed customers There is a minimum credit score requirement for this repayment plan to be available.

equity amount available If the property is to be a main residence there must be a minimum equity amount available. The equity amount is calculated as the property value minus interest only amount: Up to 50% interest only the minimum equity requirement will be £300,000 For >50%-60% the minimum equity will be £500,000 For >60%-75% the minimum equity will be £750,000 For part Interest Only / part capital and interest repayment lending the minimum equity will be calculated at the end of the mortgage term, not at point of application. The maximum Loan To Value (LTV) on Interest Only is 75%; part interest only / part capital and interest repayment is available with the balance above the SOMP interest only amount, up to a maximum 85% LTV, on a capital and interest repayment basis. The term on any Capital & Interest Repayment element cannot exceed the term on Interest Only If the property is on the ‘second home' scheme the minimum equity requirement does not apply and a maximum LTV of 75% can be on Interest Only It is important the customer understands the requirement to sell their property at the end of the term to repay the Interest Only loan amount Lending Into Retirement – the term of any Interest Only lending must not exceed the Maximum Working Age of 70 where Sale of Mortgage Property is being used as a Repayment Plan (except where property is ‘second home' where a longer term may be considered).

Existing Halifax mortgage customers moving home If an existing customer does not meet the current interest only rules we may consider allowing interest only on the new mortgage up to the level held currently, provided the mortgage term is not increasing. Please refer to your BDM for guidance. Lending into retirement expandable section The maximum age at the end of the mortgage term is 80 years for all lending. Future retirement income will need to be verified where the customer is taking a mortgage term which extends beyond the earlier of their anticipated retirement age or a maximum working age, for which we will use 70 or 75. Affordability will be assessed on the future retirement income. On occasions, a further review will be required to confirm we feel it is appropriate for the customer to lend into retirement. The applicant's plans should be discussed in view of their occupation, and reasonability of working beyond state pension age should be documented where appropriate. We will require a ‘Customer Working Age form’ (PDF, 3.14MB) to be completed by all customers on an application where the mortgage term passes a working age of 70 for any customer. This form asks the customer(s) to confirm they have considered the implications of the term chosen and that they believe they can continue to work until the age indicated. The completed form will be required before we can proceed to offer. Please see also Maximum Working Age. The types of evidence which can be used to verify anticipated retirement income are as follows: Private / Company Pension Forecast Statement dated within the last 18 months State Pension Statement dated within last 18 months which must be obtained by the customer directly as an actual statement with their name and address on it (this can be obtained from The Pension Service).

Otherwise the loan to value would have to be reduced to 75% LTV to proceed. Permanent right to reside can include: As part of the EU Settlement Scheme EEA, EU and Swiss citizens, living in the UK by 31 December 2020 can apply to continue to live in the UK after 30 June 2021 and will receive one of two statuses which are both acceptable: Settled status (awarded where they have lived in UK for at least 5 years and also known as 'indefinite leave to remain under the EU Settlement Scheme'). Pre-settled status (awarded where lived in the UK for less than 5 years and they can re apply for settled status after 5 years continuous residence in UK has been reached). Indefinite leave to enter or remain. Republic of Ireland citizens do not need to apply under the EU Settlement Scheme and have automatic permanent right to reside in the UK (no proof of permanent right to reside is required for ROI citizens). Proof of permanent right to reside could be verified to one of the following: An immigration status 'share code' - customers who can view their immigration status online at gov.uk can provide a share code which lasts for 30 days and we can use to view their immigration status e.g. settled or pre-settled status.

Letter from the Home Office confirming indefinite right to remain in the UK. When an application has one customer who has lived in the UK for more than 5 years, or meets the minimum income requirement above, or is a maximum 75% LTV then there is no requirement for the customer(s) to hold a particular type of visa or to have a minimum remaining visa validity. ‘Lived in the UK for more than 5 years …’ means lived in the UK for at least the latest 5 years, but the customer may have spent period(s) aboard within the last 5 years. We will use data provided by the credit reference agencies to determine if a customer has lived in the UK for more than 5 years. Alternatively we can accept proof from the customer e.g. a bank statement, HMRC tax notification, Local Authority Tax Bill or utility bill dated over 5 years ago. To calculate the income of £75,000 or £100,000 we will include the total of all earned incomes or the latest year’s income for self employed customers. On Shared Equity and Shared Ownership schemes, to determine if the <=75% loan to value (LTV) criteria has been met, the percentage LTV is calculated as the loan amount against the value of the customer's equity share.

A sub-sale occurs when a property is bought and then sold on within six months, i.e. the borrower is buying the property from someone who has themselves bought the property less than six months before. The date of registration at the Land Registry is how we determine the length of ownership. This means that the current vendor must have owned the property for at least six months before we can accept an application to purchase that property. A back-to-back transaction is a type of sub-sale where the intervening seller buys from the original seller and sells on to the borrower on the same day or within a few days. We also regard as sub-sales, cases where the seller acquires the freehold (or superior leasehold) title to the property, which they then immediately sell on to the borrower by the grant to them of a lease (or sub-lease). The following cases are exceptions where it is acceptable for the property to be sold on within six months of acquisition by the seller. Where sales are by: A personal representative of the registered proprietor; or An institutional mortgagee exercising its power of sale; or A receiver, trustee-in-bankruptcy or liquidator; or A developer or builder selling a property acquired under a part-exchange scheme. A registered Housing Provider (Housing Association) exercising a power of sale. We will also accept inherited properties where the applicant is a beneficiary but has not owned the property for 6 months. Applications where the applicant is not a beneficiary of the inherited property and the beneficiary has owned the property for less than 6 months are not acceptable and must be declined. The conveyancer will be responsible for ensuring the application meets the acceptable criteria. Applications which involve assignable contracts or irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of intervening sellers are not acceptable. Any other structure to the transaction which has a similar effect should be reported to us. Sub Sales & Back to Back transactions expandable section Sub-sales and back-to-back transactions are not acceptable.

Back to top Income, employment and affordability Affordability, LTI and Income Multiples expandable section Halifax use affordability as a way of assessing how much they will lend. Where the loan requested is above the maximum loan available from our affordability calculation the loan amount should be reduced to proceed or the application will be declined. Please refer to our affordability calculator. PLEASE NOTE: The affordability calculator will give a guide to the amount we would be willing to lend however, as no credit search is carried out please be aware that this amount is subject to change once the Decision in Principle (DIP) is keyed. When calculating affordability, the following Loan to Income (LTI) caps also apply. These can be used to calculate the maximum loan that would be available based on income but these are caps and the actual maximum loan could be lower and can be impacted by loan to value and credit score. Income LTV Loans <=£750K Loans >£750K Income <£40K LTV 0 - 95% Loans <=£750K 4.49x Loans >£750K N/A Income £40K - <£50K LTV 0 - 85% 85.01 - 95% Loans <=£750K 4.75x 4.49x Loans >£750K N/A Income £50K - £75K LTV 0 - 75% 75.01 - 85% 85.01 - 95% Loans <=£750K 5.00x 5.00x 4.49x Loans >£750K N/A Income >£75K - £125K LTV 0 - 75% 75.01 - 85% 85.01 - 90% 90.01 - 95% Loans <=£750K 5.50x 5.00x 4.75x (loan <=£500K) 4.49x (loan >£500K - <=£750K) 4.49x Loans >£750K 5.50x 5.00x N/A N/A Income >£125K LTV 0 - 85% 85.01% - 90% 90.01 - 95% Loans <=£750K 5.50x 4.75x (loan <=£500K) 4.49x (loan >£500K - <=£750K) 4.49x Loans >£750K 5.50x N/A N/A First time buyer Boost Income LTV LTI Income £50K+ LTV 0 - 90% LTI 5.50x Income £50K+

Any applicant is a first-time buyer (could be one applicant on a joint application, key FTB as first applicant). Total income on application is £50,000 or more. Loan to value (LTV) is 90% or less. Not available on shared equity or shared ownership schemes. For applications with any element of self-employed income please refer to the standard LTI table. For a small number of applications the overall credit profile may restrict the LTI applied to 5.00x rather than 5.50x shown, or the level of credit score may mean standard LTIs will apply. Please note: If the loan is for an Affordable Housing scheme (Shared Equity or Shared Ownership) then a scheme max LTI of 4.49x would apply. If there is any element of self-employed income on an application and the application income is up to £75k, a maximum LTI of 4.49x will apply. For loans where the application income >£75k, and there is any element of self employed income, the normal 5.50x maximum LTI applies up to 75% LTV. For loans >£500,000 to £750,000 of 85.01% to 95% LTV and for loans >£750,000 to £1m of 75.01% to 85% LTV a 4.00x LTI will apply. For like for like remortgage customers with no additional borrowing, who receive employed income only, up to 75% loan to value (LTV) and subject to credit score a 5.50x LTI will apply where the standard LTI would normally be below this level. A maximum LTI of 4.49x will still apply for remortgages on an Affordable Housing scheme (Shared Equity or Shared Ownership). The level of credit score achieved and overall credit profile may restrict the LTI applied; this may be restricted to 4.49x, to 5.00x rather than 5.50x shown and if income >£75k and loan >£500k where 4.49x shows this may be restricted to 4.00x. A different maximum LTI may sometimes apply as a result of the particular product selected. A property’s Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating is used in our affordability calculations allowing us to reflect a more tailored view of energy costs. A customer whose property has a higher EPC rating (e.g. A/B) will generally have lower energy costs than those with a lower EPC rating (F/G) on like-for-like use. For properties with an A/B EPC rating you may see a small increase in the maximum loan amount available and for properties with an F/G EPC rating a small decrease. There is no change to the maximum loan available for properties with a C, D or E EPC rating or where the EPC is unknown. For some customers we may make a deduction within our affordability calculation to allow for financial planning commitments the customer may have going forward. Within our affordability calculation we may apply an affordability adjustment for some contractors to take into account likely business expenses. In some circumstances we may deduct credit commitments as ongoing in our affordability calculation even when customers have declared

an intention to repay these. If the maximum loan available is reduced as a result then the loan amount must be reduced to proceed. When calculating affordability on interest only loans, Halifax will take into account the monthly premiums payable for the relevant repayment vehicle i.e. existing endowment or new or existing ISA. Please ensure the premium(s) is specified at both DIP and full application. Affordability must also include future changes to income and expenditure. Where the maximum loan available is below that requested there may be the option to extend the term (up to retirement) or extend term into retirement (subject to evidence of adequate retirement income). Please note, if the maximum loan available is reduced due to income not being evidenced at the declared level then the loan amount must be reduced accordingly. Only in the below scenarios may we consider a loan amount above the maximum loan from our affordability model: Existing Halifax mortgage customers with no increase in in loan amount or loan to value (LTV) compared with their current mortgage (see Existing Customers). There is additional income, not previously considered, that is expected for the life of the mortgage and can be evidenced in line with our requirements.

Contractors expandable section Where a customer's income comes from a contract and they are not employed on a permanent basis they are classed as a contractor. This will include individuals who are self-employed and pay their own tax, those who are employed via an umbrella company who deduct their tax and people who are essentially employed but on a fixed/short term contract e.g. 12 months. Contractors can be treated as self-employed or employed for income verification purposes: Self Employed Treat as Self Employed if: The customer pays their own tax, OR Has more than 1 contract, OR Has set up a limited company and employs other contractors. Income is confirmed as standard for self-employed customers. Employed Treat as Employed if: Tax is paid by the company they work for (or they are employed via an umbrella company who deduct tax) OR Contractors who earn more than £500 per day or £75k per annum, OR are an IT contractor on any income, can be treated as employed irrespective if the customer pays their own tax, or classes themselves as self-employed. (The only exception to this is where a customer has more than one contract or they have set up a limited company and employs other contractors, in which case they should be treated as self-employed). Additionally to be treated as employed the customer must have either: 12 months or more continuous employment, with 6 months of the contract remaining, or 2 years continuous service (for the last 2 years as at the date of application) in the same type of employment When we are treating a contractor as employed for income verification these are our requirements: Contractor who pays own tax, or

it is deducted by umbrella company (including IR35) Copy of latest contract and latest month’s payslip(s) required (or where payslips not issued latest month’s bank statement). Income to be used is the lower of the gross value of the contract or income calculated from payslip(s)/bank statement. Gross value of contract is calculated as daily rate on the contract x 5 days per week x 46 weeks per year (or hourly rate x 7 hours per day x 5 days per week x 46 weeks per year). Unless the contract states the actual hours/days worked are lower in which case use these figures. Income from payslip(s)/bank statement is calculated by multiplying the gross pay received to give an annual figure and then calculating the income based on a 46 week year (unless the contract states the actual weeks to be worked is lower in which case use these figures) e.g. multiply gross pay on a monthly payslip x 12, divide by 52 weeks and multiply by 46 (or average the gross pay on the weekly payslips and x 46). The total gross pay showing on umbrella payslips may be broken down by basic salary, commission, ‘additional taxable income', holiday pay etc. but as long as the contract confirms the contractor is paid via a daily rate, or hourly rate, the income does not need to be split into these separate elements and can all be keyed as basic salary. The lower of the two figures calculated is keyed as income and used for affordability. For customers who have set up a Limited Company or a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) the income evidence must be from the actual contracted employer not their own Limited Company. Contractors who are set up as a Limited Company may not be entitled to the full income of the contract where there is more than one shareholder. If there are other shareholders, and they are also to be named on the mortgage the income from the contract must be keyed for one customer only and no income from this contract can be keyed for the other applicants that are shareholders. If there are other shareholders, but they are not to be named on the mortgage the income should be keyed to reflect the customer share e.g. if 50% share then 50% of income should be used. Fixed/Short Term or Agency; tax is deducted by employer (not including IR35) The latest month’s payslip(s) must be used to evidence income, or latest 3 months’ payslips where other income is being used. Income from payslip is calculated by multiplying the gross pay received to give an annual figure and then calculating the income based on a 46 week year e.g. multiply gross pay on a monthly payslip x 12, divide by 52 weeks and multiply by 46 (or average the gross pay on the weekly payslips and x 46). Construction Industry Scheme Contractors (CIS) Applications from customers employed on a Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) Contract will be considered. Income should

--- CHUNK 38 ---
be evidenced using the latest 3 months consecutive payslips/invoices/statement along with corresponding bank statements (this could be from the same or different contracts). For example, if income in January, February and March is used, payslips/invoices/statement and corresponding bank statements must be for January, February and March. An average of the latest 3 months income should be used. This average amount should then be calculated based on a 46 week year e.g. multiply the average monthly pay x 12, divide by 52 weeks and multiply by 46. If no income is received or the customer is unable to provide both pieces of evidence of income, then ‘zero' income must be used for that month. Customers should be treated as self-employed if they pay their own tax or sub contract to more than one company. Zero hours contracts Applications from customers employed on a zero hours contract for over 12 months will be considered. Proof of all income in the last 12 months is required and that total income figure will be used. Probation Income from probationary employment is only used where the probationary period is part of a permanent contract. If the contract is purely probationary with the employer having the option to terminate the contract then this income cannot be used. It is important that probationary contracts are keyed accurately as follows: Where the applicant receives an offer of permanent employment and the contract states an initial probationary period e.g. three or six months, it should be keyed as 'permanent'. The income will be used in the affordability assessment. Where the applicant is offered a probationary contract, e.g. for three months, at the end of which the employer has the option to determine if a permanent contract will be offered, it should be keyed as ‘probationary'. The income will not be used in the affordability assessment. Professional Sports People Applications will be considered from Professional Sports People where either continuous employment of 12 months or more with 6 months of the contract remaining or 2 years continuous service (for the last two years as at the date of application) in the same type of employment can be confirmed. It is essential to establish that such individuals will have the ability to sustainably meet the monthly repayments as they near the end of their career or if their career should be ended abruptly due to injury. Contractors expandable section Where a customer's income comes from a contract and they are not employed on a permanent basis they are classed as a contractor. This will include individuals who are self-employed and pay their own tax, those who are employed via an umbrella company who deduct their tax and people who are essentially employed but on a fixed/short term contract e.g. 12 months. Contractors can be treated as self-employed or employed for income verification purposes: Self Employed Treat as Self Employed if: The customer pays their own tax, OR Has more than 1 contract, OR Has set up a limited company and employs

--- CHUNK 39 ---
other contractors. Income is confirmed as standard for self-employed customers. Employed Treat as Employed if: Tax is paid by the company they work for (or they are employed via an umbrella company who deduct tax) OR Contractors who earn more than £500 per day or £75k per annum, OR are an IT contractor on any income, can be treated as employed irrespective if the customer pays their own tax, or classes themselves as self-employed.

Professional Sports People Applications will be considered from Professional Sports People where either continuous employment of 12 months

--- CHUNK 41 ---
or more with 6 months of the contract remaining or 2 years continuous service (for the last two years as at the date of application) in the same type of employment can be confirmed. It is essential to establish that such individuals will have the ability to sustainably meet the monthly repayments as they near the end of their career or if their career should be ended abruptly due to injury. Non-Sterling income (Foreign income) expandable section Non-sterling income can be accepted on purchase, remortgage, further advance (FA) and product transfer (PT) applications where a full affordability assessment is required. There is no minimum income level for non-sterling income to be used. For FAs/PTs non-sterling income can be used even if this was not included on the original purchase/remortgage application. We will accept income in the following five non-sterling currencies: US Dollar, Euro, Australian Dollar, Indian Rupee and Swiss Franc. The income types we’ll accept in non-sterling are employed basic salary, bonus, overtime and commission. Non-Sterling income cannot be accepted for ‘other income’ types. The only self-employed income acceptable in non-sterling is a partner of an LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) where the income can be keyed as self-employed and is verified to a letter from a finance director. We can include sterling income and non-sterling income on the same application, but we can only use one non-sterling currency on an application. Our website Mortgage affordability calculator will collect non-sterling incomes. This calculation is based on current exchange rates so when an application is made they may receive a different rate. When a Decision in Principle (DIP) is keyed the exchange rate to be used on that application will not then change, so the maximum loan available would not change due to any currency fluctuations. On our income screens you’ll see a new currency dropdown field and should key in the amount in the originating non-sterling currency, not the equivalent GBP amount. We’ll convert the income amount to GBP and apply a haircut of 20% (10% for bonus income) to cover any potential currency fluctuations. For income verification if payslips show the amount in the originating currency that is sufficient, but if they only show the converted GBP figure you should upload a compensation letter/remuneration statement in addition to the payslip(s). This document should show the income amount in the original currency which is what we will require. The compensation letter/remuneration statement can be a document that was sent directly to the customer by their employer, or received online but should show: Employer name Employee name (to match the application and payslip) Pay date Non-sterling currency using Income type e.g. salary or bonus clearly denoted. Payslips and any other documents must be in English language. All mortgage applicants must be UK residents which means they must have a ‘primary address’ in the UK. If someone’s primary address is outside the UK and they only have a correspondence address in the UK they are not a UK resident and a correspondence or

--- CHUNK 42 ---
family member’s address must not be declared as a primary address. A primary address does not need to be the address where someone spends the majority, or even a certain proportion, of their time e.g. they could spend the majority of their time at a foreign address due to working abroad but still have their primary address in the UK. This is not the same as ‘tax residency’ and we do not require customers meet any tax resident requirements. Non-sterling income is any income other than sterling received by a customer; non-sterling income converted to GBP to be paid into a UK bank account is still considered to be non-sterling income. Channel Islands/Crown Dependencies i.e. Jersey, Guernsey and Isle of Man plus Gibraltar and Falkland Islands should be treated as GBP and not non-sterling. Please note the amount of any ‘haircuts’ are subject to change. When non-sterling income is used two additional paragraphs will show on the Mortgage Illustration in the ‘Main features of loan’ and ‘Amount of each instalment’ sections. A letter will be sent to the customer after completion if the exchange rate goes down by more than 20% to advise them and confirm the support available if required. Q – Can you accept a contractor with a contract in a non-sterling currency? A – Yes, standard contractor income verification requirements would apply; a copy of the contract would be required together with bank statements or payslips to show the actual income being received. If bank statements only show the converted GBP amount received then to consider the application payslips or a compensation letter/remuneration statement would need to be available to show the amount received in the non-sterling currency Q – What is the treatment for seafarer contractors? A – The seafarers employment type refers to people who may work in various different roles on a seagoing vessel e.g. on a cruise ship or oil rig. Seafarers can be permanently employed but are most commonly contractors who are responsible for paying their own tax (which includes people who may say they are ‘tax exempt’) and for seafarer contractors the following treatment should be followed: Seafarer contractors – non-sterling income: Do they receive the equivalent of more than £500 per day or £75,000 per annum? Yes – follow our standard contractor policy A copy of the contract would be required together with bank statements or payslips to show the actual income being received. If bank statements only show the converted GBP amount received then to consider the application payslips or a compensation letter/remuneration statement would need to be available to show the amount received in the non-sterling currency No – the application cannot be considered Below the income level required to follow contractor policy they would need to be treated as self-employed, and we cannot consider self-employed income if non-sterling Seafarer contractors – sterling (GBP) income: Follow the standard treatment of contractor or self-employed given the customer’s employment basis/income level Q – Can you accept a self-employed customer where

--- CHUNK 43 ---
the business receives some income from overseas? A – If a company is not UK based we could not use self-employed income as we would be unable to evidence this income per our standard self-employed verification requirements. If a company is UK based we will use sterling income as evidenced on tax calculations (SA302s) and tax year overviews as normal ; if a ‘Foreign income’ amount is shown on the SA302 this amount should not be included in the income keyed Q – How do I key a bonus received in different currencies in each of the last 2 years e.g. previous year bonus in US$ and latest year in GBP? A – Only the latest year’s bonus could be used. The currency selected would be the currency of the latest year’s bonus. A two year average would be calculated using the latest year’s bonus amount and zero bonus for the previous year Q – Do customers need to be paid into a UK bank account? A – No, there is no specific requirement that income is paid into a UK bank account. All applicants must be UK residents as normal Q – Do payslips need to show UK tax being deducted? A – No, there is no requirement for payslips to show UK tax being deducted, and they could show no tax or foreign tax being deducted.

The reference must be addressed to the Halifax and quote our reference number. The reference must be signed and dated, and the name and position of the person completing the reference must be provided. Any alterations must be clearly marked and initialled.

The maximum working age applied will be 70 for: Remortgage applications with any capital raising/additional borrowing Applications with any amount on interest only Some purchase and remortgage applications because of the level of credit score achieved and overall credit profile. If a term past 70 years of age is selected for an application restricted to a maximum working age of 70 a Corrective Action message will fire a Decision in Principle (DIP): ‘As the maximum working age on this application is 70 the term chosen extends into retirement, anticipated retirement income must be keyed or the term reduced to a maximum of … (years)’. The maximum working age applied will be 75 on product transfer and further advance applications. The applicant's plans should be discussed in view of their occupation, and reasonability of working beyond state pension age should be documented where appropriate. We will require a ‘Customer Working Age form’ (PDF, 3.6MB) to be completed by all customers on an application where the mortgage term passes a working age of 70 for any customer. This form asks the customer(s) to confirm they have considered the implications of the term chosen and that they believe they can continue to work until the age indicated. The completed form will be required before we can proceed to offer. Future retirement income will need to be verified where the customer is taking a mortgage term which extends beyond the lower of the declared ‘Anticipated Retirement Age’ or the maximum working age being applied.

raising/additional borrowing Applications with any amount on interest only Some purchase and remortgage applications because of the level of credit score achieved and overall credit profile. If a term past 70 years of age is selected for an application restricted to a maximum working age of 70 a Corrective Action message will fire a Decision in Principle (DIP): ‘As the maximum working age on this application is 70 the term chosen extends into retirement, anticipated retirement income must be keyed or the term reduced to a maximum of … (years)’. The maximum working age applied will be 75 on product transfer and further advance applications. The applicant's plans should be discussed in view of their occupation, and reasonability of working beyond state pension age should be documented where appropriate. We will require a ‘Customer Working Age form’ (PDF, 3.6MB) to be completed by all customers on an application where the mortgage term passes a working age of 70 for any customer. This form asks the customer(s) to confirm they have considered the implications of the term chosen and that they believe they can continue to work until the age indicated. The completed form will be required before we can proceed to offer. Future retirement income will need to be verified where the customer is taking a mortgage term which extends beyond the lower of the declared ‘Anticipated Retirement Age’ or the maximum working age being applied.

Back to top Property questions and valuation Acceptable Property Types expandable section Each application will be assessed on its own merits although there are some property types which are specifically excluded. Do we lend on any property? No. We require experienced RICS (Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors) qualified surveyors to consider all the factors that may affect the suitability of a property to be mortgaged and whether or not it is readily saleable. Factors may include property construction, type, location, uses and environmental issues. Each case will be assessed on its own merits. Some property types such as houseboats, mobile homes and timeshares are specifically excluded. Do we lend on houses or flats/maisonettes made from precast reinforced concrete (PRC) that have been designated defective under the 1985 housing act? Generally not, unless the property has been repaired to a scheme that is approved by us. Flats/maisonettes which are designated defective PRC type are not acceptable. Do we lend on PRC properties that have been repaired but have no repair certificate? No. However, we will accept a ‘retrospective repair certificate’ confirming the repair has been undertaken to the standards laid down in the PRC Homes Repair Scheme or those accepted by us. The certificate must be in a format with wording required by us and prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced professional. Do we lend on non-traditionally constructed properties? Yes, subject to inspection and design. Each case is considered on its own merits. How big does the property have to be for a mortgage? Our general policy is to consider very property on its individual merits. We do not impose any size restrictions and no property is rejected solely on the grounds of size. A property must however meet the minimum criteria of being habitable, readily saleable and structurally sound. The property is situated above a shop/commercial property, is it suitable for a mortgage? There are no specific restrictions although some commercial uses may have a detrimental effect on saleability and every case is viewed on its own merits. The following guidance may be helpful: Any residential security must have a suitable access, which must

--- CHUNK 71 ---
not be through a business premises. Caution must be exercised where the title of the residential property has been separated from a larger title that includes commercial activity, particularly when this has been done specifically for the purpose of the proposed mortgage. This can sometimes lead to an unusual residential property that may suit the proposed applicants but would be more difficult to sell on the open market. The residential security must meet the general principles regarding saleability. The property must be self-contained, with its own private facilities and separate services. Do we lend on high rise flats? Every case is viewed on its own merits, subject to construction and saleability. Certain types e.g. large panel systems (LPS) have specific requirements. Do we lend on properties with short leases? For leasehold properties to be acceptable, there must be a minimum of 70 years unexpired on the term of the lease at the time of the mortgage application. Do we lend on houses or flats with solar panels/photo voltaic cells? We will not usually lend on blocks of leasehold flats where photo voltaic cells have been fitted, but there are some exceptions. Houses with leased solar panels are acceptable for lending providing the agreed lease is acceptable to us. This will be confirmed through the conveyancer or by checking our approved list. The valuer must be satisfied that the photo voltaic cells or solar panels have no impact on the structural integrity of the property and will be taken in to account when assessing value and saleability.

Assignable Contracts expandable section Applications which involve assignable contracts or irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of intervening sellers are not acceptable.

Distressed sale and leaseback expandable section Applications that involve a distressed sale or a sale and leaseback are not acceptable. Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) expandable section On purchase applications valid EPC details for the property are always required. On remortgages if the property has a valid EPC this must be captured, but if the property does not have a valid EPC the remortgage application can still proceed. When property details are completed we will display on the EPC Details screen the latest EPC record to be used for the application. This EPC information comes from our database which is based on the Government EPC register. Please check the EPC showing is valid (within 10 years) and is the latest EPC available for the property. If the latest EPC is not showing details will need to be keyed: Current Energy Efficiency Rating Potential Energy Efficiency Rating EPC Certificate/Reference Number EPC date field (‘Valid Until’ for England/Wales/NI or ‘Date of Certificate’ for Scotland). The screen has a ‘Check EPC Register’ button to open the Government register to see if a new EPC record shows, otherwise please refer to the customer who may need to speak to the agent/vendor or developer/builder to obtain the necessary information. For the purchase of new build properties an EPC may not be available, we will accept a Predicted Energy Assessment (PEA) or Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) rating and these details should be keyed. On remortgage applications if an EPC does not exist for the property EPC details do not need to be manually keyed. If EPC details are manually keyed and we request proof of the EPC this must be uploaded with the other verification documents e.g. EPC Certificate, PEA/SAP document for new build or where a property is ‘exempt’ a completed exemptions template (PDF, 48KB). A property’s Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating is used in our affordability calculations allowing us to reflect a more tailored view of energy costs. A customer whose property has a higher EPC rating (e.g. A/B) will generally have lower energy costs than those with a lower EPC rating (F/G) on like-for-like use. For properties with an A/B EPC rating you may see a small increase in the maximum loan amount available and for properties with an F/G EPC rating a small decrease. There is no change to the maximum loan available for properties with a C, D or E EPC rating or where the EPC is unknown. Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) expandable section On purchase applications valid EPC details for the property are always required. On remortgages if the property has a valid EPC this must be captured, but if the property does not have a valid EPC the remortgage application can still proceed. When property details are completed we will display on the EPC Details screen the latest EPC record to be used for the application. This EPC information

--- CHUNK 74 ---
comes from our database which is based on the Government EPC register. Please check the EPC showing is valid (within 10 years) and is the latest EPC available for the property. If the latest EPC is not showing details will need to be keyed: Current Energy Efficiency Rating Potential Energy Efficiency Rating EPC Certificate/Reference Number EPC date field (‘Valid Until’ for England/Wales/NI or ‘Date of Certificate’ for Scotland). The screen has a ‘Check EPC Register’ button to open the Government register to see if a new EPC record shows, otherwise please refer to the customer who may need to speak to the agent/vendor or developer/builder to obtain the necessary information. For the purchase of new build properties an EPC may not be available, we will accept a Predicted Energy Assessment (PEA) or Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) rating and these details should be keyed. On remortgage applications if an EPC does not exist for the property EPC details do not need to be manually keyed. If EPC details are manually keyed and we request proof of the EPC this must be uploaded with the other verification documents e.g. EPC Certificate, PEA/SAP document for new build or where a property is ‘exempt’ a completed exemptions template (PDF, 48KB).

EWS1 and Cladding expandable section Due to provisions laid down under the Building Safety Act 2022 we will not require any further information on buildings containing 5 storeys and above in England and these applications can proceed as normal. For these properties we will ask the purchaser’s conveyancer to gather information relating to the current leaseholder as there may be some situations where a leaseholder may have to contribute to cladding remediation. These cases will be referred by the purchaser’s conveyancer for us to review further. All high rise buildings in Wales (5 storeys or 11 meters and above) are eligible for remediation. We will not require any further information and these applications can proceed as normal. For Scotland & Northern Ireland (all buildings) and buildings 4 storeys and below in England and Wales in line with RICS guidance to valuers we may ask for an EWS1 before a valuation figure can be provided. It is the responsibility of the building owner and/or its agent (in Scotland individual customers have to source the EWS1 form) as the responsible person to: Confirm that an external wall system (EWS)

or attachments, such as a balcony, on buildings containing flats has been assessed by a suitable expert for likelihood of proportionate remediation to address fire safety risk. The EWS1 form must be prepared by a fully qualified competent member of a relevant professional body. Please see ‘Who carries out the EWS1 assessment, and what is their expertise?’ on the RICS Cladding External Wall System (EWS) FAQs. We will be unable to confirm if a property is acceptable until a valuation has been instructed. For purchase cases a special condition will be added to a mortgage offer to instruct the conveyancer to advise the customer that the offer has been made on the reliance of an EWS1.

Will the Surveyor need access to the property? If the valuation is a Level 1 Valuation or Level 2 Survey and Valuation then access will be required to the property and arrangements will be made directly with the occupier or agent. Do you offer level 3 Building Surveys? No. Your client can find a surveyor to complete this for them, we do not offer Building Surveys. Why are some instructions panelled? E.surv are our surveyor of choice and wherever possible will carry out the valuation instruction. However where e.surv do not have coverage or to ensure we meet the needs of your clients, the instruction may be panelled to a member of e.surv's Valuation Panel who are administered by e.surv. Both e.surv and the valuation panel follow the same lender guidance provided by us and are audited on a regular basis. Why does my client need to sign the Terms of Engagement documentation you have sent them? Terms of Engagement are issued in order to reflect accurately the scope of the service to be provided so that your client is in a position to fully understand what service the firm is providing to them. As such, a report cannot be released to them until the Terms of Engagement have been read, signed and returned by the client. Does my client need to provide the Surveyor with any paperwork when they visit the property? No, the surveyor will have all the information they need. Does my client need to be present? No, as long as there is a person over the age of 18 that can let the surveyor in. Alternatively the surveyor can collect the key from a neighbour or estate agent for example. Will the surveyor need access to the loft? For Level 1 Valuation inspections access is generally not needed, although there may be occasions when the surveyor will want to have

--- CHUNK 82 ---
access to complete their investigations. Access will always be required for the Level 2 Survey. Is a copy of the Valuation Report sent to the solicitor? E.surv surveyors are unable to release valuation reports directly to solicitors. If your client requires a copy by post, fax or email then they must request it directly from e.surv. Please be aware that we cannot send reports to solicitors or any other third party at your client's request. We can only issue the report directly to your client. Can I discuss an existing case with e.surv if I am not named on the application? E.surv are only able to discuss valuation instructions with an applicant named on the case. The named applicant can authorise us to discuss the case with another party by calling and setting up a specific agreed security password. Does the Valuation Report contain an insurance or rebuild valuation figure? No, an insurance figure is generally not provided on the report. Your client can obtain an insurance figure independently by visiting the Association of British Insurers (ABI) website. The ABI website has a residential rebuilding cost calculator. Your client will be required to register with the website but can then log in and obtain a rebuilding/insurance figure for free. What kind of comparable research on properties is used by the surveyor? Our reports are provided in accordance with the RICS Valuation – Professional Standards. When preparing reports, valuers compare evidence of recent sales in order to provide an opinion of value at a specific point in time. Ideally comparables include properties within the immediate locality offering similar accommodation and style to that of the subject property. However, comparable evidence need not be identical and it is sometimes the case that no direct comparable evidence is available. In such cases the valuer will use their experience to adjust for any variances in matters such as size, condition and specific location or geographical appeal. Valuers consider a wide range of comparable evidence and their research is thorough. Details of properties currently on the market and valuations provided by estate agents do not relate to realised sale values. Also, estate agent marketing appraisals are prepared for a different purpose than mortgage valuation or survey reports. Such information cannot be considered in lieu of comparable sales evidence. My client has received an encrypted mail from e.surv, how do they open it? All emails containing sensitive and confidential information are sent using the Symantec secure email encryption service. The initial email will contain a link which takes your client to the Symantec service so they can register as a new user, including creating their own password. Symantec is not compatible with mobile devices therefore a desktop or laptop computer will be required to open the email (PDF, 547kB). Will my client be charged a fee if the valuation is cancelled? A fee is not charged if the surveyor does not either visit the property or accept the instruction. If the surveyor visits the property and

--- CHUNK 83 ---
finds it unsuitable they will complete a Level 1 Property Risk Assessment and confirm that they cannot give a valuation figure. They will point out that the property is unsuitable for lending and provide the reason. The valuation fee is payable in these circumstances. Will you report on the property's condition? Level 1 Valuations are based on a limited inspection of the property highlighting only those items that are deemed to have a material impact on value. It is prepared in order for us to make an assessment of our loan to your client. It is not a survey of condition and is not designed to list individual property defects. It should not be relied on for their buying decision. Level 2 Survey and Valuations report on specific condition matters and other issues to the extent outlined in the individual Terms of Engagement, which could affect a decision to buy. We base our lending decisions on the valuation aspects only. Why might my client need a specialist report? Occasionally serious or potentially serious defects are found. The surveyor may not be able to provide a valuation without further investigation so a Specialist Report is requested. Serious defects warranting further investigation may include dry rot, structural movement, trees and drains but this is not an exhaustive list. If a Structural Engineers Report is required this should be a focused report on the specific defect(s) referred to e.g. cracking, structural movement, subsidence, roof deflection, trees potentially causing damage, suspected drain failure etc. General reports on condition such as: Building Surveys, RICS Homebuyer reports etc. are not acceptable. The report must be addressed to our applicants and not the vendor, must detail the property address and must be signed off by a professional with the required qualifications, either: Structural Engineer (with qualification M.I.C.E, F.I.C.E, IM.I Struct E, M.I.

We support customers throughout the life of their mortgage and will work with them to remedy any difficulties wherever possible. Financial difficulty is defined by the following categorisation: Budgetary Issues: Able to afford current commitments and expenditure but poor at managing day to day control. Overspending: Able to afford current commitments but spending on non-essentials means an overall negative budget. Need to reduce spending in order to meet priority payments. Temporary Difficulties: Loss of job, sickness, relationship breakdown, bereavement etc. resulting in reduced income and unable to support current spending and/or commitments. Temporary assistance required until income level restored and/or spending permanently reduced. Over-committed: Unable to afford current commitments even after reducing non-essential spending. This may require restructuring of any unsecured credit commitments at non-concessionary rates and reduced spending to meet priority payments such as their mortgage. Over-indebted: Unable to afford current commitments and unable to reduce spending to make priority payments and budget affordable. It may require the ability to make reduced repayments within concessionary repayment plans.

Overpayments & Payment Holidays expandable section Overpayments Lump sum or regular overpayments can be made at any time. If early repayment charges apply to the product, refer to early repayment charges for more details. Payment holidays If your clients wish to take a payment holiday and if they meet criteria it may be possible for them to take up to a maximum of 6 months over the lifetime of their mortgage. One holiday is allowed every 3 years with a maximum of 2 months per instance. A payment holiday can be requested for any reason and each circumstance should be individually assessed using questioning skills to establish if this is the correct method to support the customer. It is very important that your client has not indicated they are in financial difficulty, and the purpose

--- CHUNK 92 ---
for the request is both reasonable and in their best interest. It is important to remember that a payment holiday is a short term solution for short term need. If your client does take a payment holiday they need to be aware that the interest usually charged will be added to the balance of the mortgage. Their account will be recalculated at the end of the payment holiday and written confirmation will be sent out approximately 2 weeks before their payment will restart. The monthly payment will be calculated at that time using the higher balance and spread throughout the remaining term. If they have any sub accounts on Interest Only they need to be aware that these balances will increase to cover the amount of accrued interest that has been added due to the missed payments. Therefore, they will need to check that their repayment plan is on track to repay this mortgage at the end of the term. Whilst your client has an active payment holiday, they will be ineligible to apply for a Further Advance or a Mortgage Review. They can only proceed with an application if they stop the payment holiday, or wait until it has ended. Criteria The mortgage must have been open for at least 12 months with no further borrowing in the last 6 months. The account must not be in arrears at the time of the application or have had any historic arrears on the account (in the last 12 months). The account must not have had any missed payments in the past 12 months. There must be no payment arrangement in force or have been within the last 6 months. The total debt on the mortgage must not exceed 75% at point of application; there will be the option for a revaluation (fee applicable). The mortgage property must not be on a Shared Ownership scheme. The mortgaged property must be the Main Residence, and is not rented out. Customer(s) must not currently be claiming on a Mortgage Repayments Insurance policy or be applying for, or be in receipt of, Income Support.

Porting Applications expandable section If an existing Halifax mortgage is repaid while an Early Repayment Charge (ERC) applies this charge will be due unless the amount on the existing product is ported to a new application, when the ERC will be waived. The ERC can also be waived without porting, if a new mortgage is being taken in the last 3 months of the ERC period. In a non-simultaneous sale and purchase scenario the ERC has to be paid but can be refunded as explained below. Please notify us when you submit any new application for an existing Halifax mortgage customer, by advising the colleague when making an initial call or by completing the Contact form (PDF, 35kB) held on our Literature page and uploading this. Please explain if the product is being ported or if not why so we can take the necessary actions. If a product is portable this is outlined in the original mortgage offer and supporting documentation. You cannot port a

--- CHUNK 94 ---
product onto a remortgage application from another lender, but can port to a remortgage of an unencumbered (mortgage free) property the customer already owns, where this will become their main residence. Where Halifax Standard Variable Rate is the reversionary rate which applies to the product being ported, it will continue to be the reversionary rate for the amount of the new mortgage which is on the ported product. Any extra amount borrowed on the new mortgage must be on a product from the current range and applicable scheme. The reversionary rate which applies to that product and the amount on it will be Halifax Homeowner Variable Rate. To port a product the new mortgage application must complete simultaneously with redemption of the current mortgage. The conveyancer must indicate a product is being ported when they obtain a redemption statement for the existing mortgage; the statement will then explain that the ERC does not need to be included in the redemption monies. If the amount to be ported to a new loan is lower than the amount currently on the product the ERC payable will be calculated on a pro rata basis. For example, if £100,000 of £200,000 on the existing product is being ported then 50% of the ERC would be charged. If the new mortgage application is completing simultaneously with redemption of the current mortgage only the partial ERC would need to be paid upon redemption. Within the last 3 months of an ERC period the product does not need to be ported to a new mortgage; as long as the new loan amount is not lower than the existing amount on the product with ERCs, a product from the new current range can be chosen for the new mortgage and the early repayment charge will be waived. Where a customer sells their property and repays their existing mortgage before they complete on a new purchase, they will incur any ERCs that apply. However, if they apply for a new mortgage with us within three months of repaying their existing mortgage, while they cannot port and would choose a new product from the current range at that time, once the new mortgage has completed we will process a refund of the ERC. This is a concession and it may not always be available. The new loan amount must not be lower than the amount previously on the product, or a partial refund of the ERC will be received on a pro rata basis. During the processing of the new application you should tell us where a refund of an ERC will be required or complete a Contact form (PDF, 35kB). You should also call us when the new mortgage completes so we can request the refund of the ERC is actioned. Buy to Let mortgage products cannot be ported onto non Buy to Let mortgages. To key to port a product on a new application: Make sure 'Existing Customer' has been chosen as 'Purchase Type' on Personal Details screen.

On the Products selection screen complete 'Roll number' or 'Account Number' with the customer's existing mortgage account: The 'Roll number' is their original application roll number - if the final digit after the dash is a single digit remember to input a zero ahead of this e.g. for 9 key '09'; 10/12345678-9 is keyed as 101234567809 Or key 'Account Number' in a 14 digit format e.g. 10/12345678-9 should be keyed as 10123456780900 including a zero ahead of the final digit if this is a single digit and two zeros at the end to make 14 digits. Any products available to port will then show. Please ensure the customer's name, date of birth and address details are keyed correctly on the new application to exactly match the existing mortgage as shown in Mortgage Enquiry, for the portable product(s) to show available.

If an application is declined as it has not passed the credit score customers have a right to appeal and whilst we'll always reconsider carefully, without new information it is very unlikely that we will be able to change our decision. This also applies where an application is declined on policy because of ‘the level of unsecured debt outstanding' or because ‘an active pay day loan is present'. Please give careful consideration before submitting an appeal for assessment. The list below provides guidance on the scenarios in which an appeal may be successful: Existing Halifax Mortgage Customers Moving house with no increase in loan amount or loan to value (LTV) compared with the current mortgage.

OR A sitting tenant purchasing from their landlord (private or council) at a discounted price (minimum of 10% discount is required). This excludes Right to Buy. The tenant must have been subject to a tenancy agreement on the property for a minimum

of 1 year. The only relationships permitted for a concessionary purchase are (including vice versa): Parents, step-parents, adoptive parents. Applicant's children, step-children, half children, adopted children. Brothers and sisters, half brothers and sisters, step-brothers and sisters. Grandparents, step-grandparents. Grandchild, step-grandchild. Aunt/Uncle. Partners or ex-partners who are not co-habiting at the property. All family purchase transactions must provide vacant possession (the vendor must be moving out) on completion. In all cases the discount on the purchase price must be a minimum of 10% of the market value and must be a genuine discount (must not be subject to any future repayment, clawback or retained interest terms). For inherited properties where a beneficiary is purchasing the other beneficiaries share, this should be keyed as a concessionary purchase. The purchase price will be the amount required to buy out the other beneficiaries. Example: Mr Smith has died leaving the property valued at £200,000 to his two sons; therefore each beneficiary has a share of £100,000. Only one son wants the property and wishes to buy out the brother's shares. In this scenario, the purchase price would be £100,000 as the applicant already owns 50% of the property. A valuation must be instructed in all cases including properties in Scotland (retypes are not permitted). Note: As the application results can differ on these cases once the correct purchase price has been keyed, you must contact The Halifax Intermediary Processing Team for all applications for Concessionary Purchase. This will ensure correct underwriting of the case has been carried out at the time of application.

First Homes Scheme expandable section The Government First Homes scheme in England allows First Time Buyers (FTB) to purchase a New Build property at a discounted purchase price under a Resale Price Covenant (RPC). The discount (which will be a minimum 30%) must be passed on if the property is sold in the future. Key eligibility criteria for First Homes scheme: All applicants must be a First Time Buyer. Local Authorities may prioritise key workers, local residents and service personnel. In England only. New Build properties only. Maximum purchase price, after discount, is £250,000 (£420,000 in London). Discount typically 30% but Local Authorities can increase up to 50%. Customer maximum income of £80,000 (£90,000 in London). Mortgage criteria: Minimum 5% personal deposit based on discounted purchase price. First Homes scheme specific products must be selected (for remortgages Affordable Housing remortgage range applies). Mortgage must be on a capital and interest repayment basis, no interest only. Minimum 50% Loan to Value (LTV) based on discounted purchased price. Example: Full market valuation = £100,000 Discount of 30% (but could be higher) = £30,000 Discounted purchase price = £70,000 Customer deposit required = £3,500 (5% of £70,000) Maximum Loan = £66,500 LTV for product selection = 67% (£66,500 loan against £100,000 full market value). A 5% personal deposit is required in addition to any incentives from the builder. The loan amount together with any incentives and any product fee being added, cannot exceed 95% of the discounted purchase price. For product selection the percentage LTV used will be loan amount against the full market value (not discounted purchase price).

On the Loan screen key the estimated property value after the percentage discount is applied e.g. if the estimated full market value is £250,000 and a 40% discount applied when the property was initially purchased key £150,000 as the estimated property value. Products should be selected from the Affordable Housing Remortgage range; the loan to value (LTV) for selecting the product is the loan amount against the full market value. Product transfer (PT) and further advance (FA) applications Please see the Product Finder within Mortgage Enquiry for the available products. The loan to value (LTV) for product selection will be the loan amount against the full value of the property. Further advance applications are not available until a mortgage has been open for 6 months.

Mortgage Prisoner expandable section Customers classed as Mortgage Prisoners by the FCA due to their current mortgage being held with a closed book lender may be able to remortgage to the Halifax. Applications will be subject to our criteria, credit scoring and affordability assessment. If a remortgage application passes our credit score but fails our affordability assessment we may still be able to consider the application. The customer must be remortgaging from a closed book lender and have received a

--- CHUNK 109 ---
letter from their existing lender stating they are classed as a Mortgage Prisoner. The remortgage application would need to meet the following criteria: A remortgage of the customer's main residence with no additional borrowing (excluding any fees). Maximum 75% loan to value (LTV). Interest Only lending is acceptable subject to verification of acceptable repayment plans for the whole amount of interest only per our normal criteria. The customer's new monthly payment must be no more than 5% higher than the current monthly payment. The mortgage cannot be on a Shared Equity or Shared Ownership scheme. The customer must not be in Financial Difficulty. Please see the definition of ‘Financial Difficulty'. If an Alternative Lending Proposal (ALP) application result is received this indicates the application has passed our credit score but failed the affordability assessment. If all of the above criteria are met please select the ‘Mortgage Prisoner' scheme in Halifax Intermediaries Online and submit the full application. You should complete and upload the Mortgage Prisoner form (PDF, 124kB) and all required documentation. Even if the above criteria are met the level of credit score achieved will be considered and the application will still be subject to a full review before we can confirm if we are able to proceed. It is important the customer has checked if there are any other financial interests registered against the property (for example if there is a second charge or charging order) and if so that these will either be removed or postponed so that Halifax has a first charge. In many cases due to the nature of the interest it will be clear from the outset that postponement is not possible and it will be necessary for the debt to the third party to be repaid on or before completion. If it becomes apparent that the Halifax mortgage cannot be registered as a first charge because of any third party interest in the property the new mortgage will not be able to proceed.

depending on the scheme. For Help to Buy Wales, the maximum property value from 01/04/2023 is £300,000. Please refer to the Welsh Government's scheme rules. The mortgage must be on a repayment basis. We do not allow any remortgage applications, where there is any element of debt consolidation. The term of the mortgage must be shorter than or equal to the equity loan term. We will apply an income multiple cap of four and a half times income on all affordable housing (shared equity and shared ownership) applications, including Help to Buy Equity Loans. Client must pay a 5% personal deposit (excluding any deposit provided by a builder or housing association). Cash incentives are acceptable provided the loan and cash incentive together do not exceed 95% of the value of the customer's equity share. If the customer is required to make interest payments for the equity loan this must be confirmed and the correct interest figure keyed for the application to proceed. The interest figure must be entered in ‘Monthly Interest Payments' field on the Schemes screen and not as a commitment under Credit Commitments. The interest charge must be keyed and taken into account in the affordability calculation even if interest is not payable from the start. For schemes with planned payment increases the higher figure should be keyed e.g. if in years 1-5 is 3% but increases to 5% from year 6, the 5% figure must be keyed. Only if the customer will never pay any interest should a zero figure be keyed. Example: 80/20 Shared Equity purchase Purchase Price = £100,000 Your customer's share = £80,000 Your customer deposit = £5,000 Mortgage required = £75,000 The maximum financial incentive which is permitted = £1,000 (95% of £80,000 = £76,000) Calculate equity loan interest payments as follows: Amount of equity retained by the builder/shared equity loan provider = £20,000 (20% of £100,000 full value) Rate of interest payable (confirmed by customer) = e.g. 4% £20,000 x 4% = £800 per annum £800 / 12 = £67 to be keyed in ‘Monthly interest payments’ field.

Example: 80/20 Shared Equity purchase Purchase Price = £100,000 Your customer's share = £80,000 Your customer deposit = £5,000 Mortgage required = £75,000 The maximum financial incentive which is permitted = £1,000 (95% of £80,000 = £76,000) Calculate equity loan interest payments as follows: Amount of equity retained by the builder/shared equity loan provider = £20,000 (20% of £100,000 full value) Rate of interest payable (confirmed by customer) = e.g. 4% £20,000 x 4% = £800 per annum £800 / 12 = £67 to be keyed in ‘Monthly interest payments’ field. Shared Ownership expandable section Shared ownership allows a customer to buy a home in stages. The customer purchases a property jointly with either a Housing Association, also known as a Registered Social Landlord or a Local Authority. The customer will own a percentage of the property, with the remaining percentage being owned by the Housing Association/Local Authority. The terms of this arrangement is set out in a shared ownership lease. When a customer applies for a mortgage to buy a shared ownership property we are only lending on a specific percentage of the property value which means the customer will own a share of the property and pay rent to the Housing Association/Local Authority for the remaining share. Some shared ownership schemes may be aimed at members of the public such as key workers. Shared Ownership is only available where the share being purchased is between 20% and 85% of the property’s value for new build

Dependants expandable section A dependant is anyone who is financially reliant on your customer, who is not a party to the mortgage and does not contribute to the mortgage payments. A dependant may be a child, spouse not party to the mortgage, adult or elderly relative or a future dependant. You need to capture separately both Child and Adult Dependants. Child Dependant A child dependant would include any children for which the customer(s) is the primary carer and who is under 18. A child dependant would include a future dependant where the customer is expecting a baby or is in the process of adopting a child. Foster children should be included as dependants. Where any children have income and can fully support themselves they do not need to be keyed as a dependant. If a child is not living with the customer(s) and maintenance is being paid, a dependant does not need to be keyed, but the maintenance amount must be keyed as a commitment. Adult Dependant An adult dependant is someone who is not party to the mortgage but is financially reliant on the customer. This could be a spouse/partner, elderly relative or grown up children who are unemployed or in full time education. Where the adult dependant resides at the property for some of the time, you would key this in the adult dependant field. Alternatively, where the customer financially supports an adult dependant who doesn't reside at the property, they would not be keyed as a dependant, but the related costs instead must be keyed as a total figure in “Other Commitments”.

Forces Help to Buy (previously called Long Service Advance of pay) Serving members of HM Forces may be able to raise capital for a deposit by means of a 'Forces Help to Buy' (FHTB) interest free loan which will be repaid by the customer through their pay. This can be accepted as a deposit for a mortgage on a main residence or when using the Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme and the repayment must be keyed as a commitment. FHTBs are repayable interest free over 10 years so to calculate the monthly payment, divide the amount borrowed under the FHTB scheme by 120. Where the deposit is funded from FHTB, the deposit type should be keyed as savings. The applicant will not receive confirmation of the FHTB amount from HM Forces until they have received their mortgage offer, so there is no requirement to obtain evidence. Concessionary If the deposit is from equity (e.g. a reduced purchase price) the application should be treated as a concessionary purchase - refer to CONCESSIONARY PURCHASE FOR CRITERIA. Vendor Deposits and Cashbacks (Non New Build Properties) Vendor Gifted Deposits are an unacceptable source of deposit for any non new build property.

It does not include the normal fee or commission payable to any estate agent handling the sale. First Monthly Payment & Initial Interest expandable section The first monthly payment is always collected in the month following completion, for example if a mortgage completes in June the first payment will be collected in July. This will be collected on the customer’s chosen monthly payment date unless completion occurs in the last few days of any month and results in less than 4 working days between the completion date and the customer's chosen payment date (excluding those days), the first payment will then be collected on the 10th of that month. This date will then revert to the customer's chosen payment date on the following month. The first monthly payment includes an amount of ‘Initial Interest’ from the day of completion to the end of that month plus the first monthly mortgage payment. For example: If completion occurs on the 15th, interest is calculated from the 15th to the end of the month and then added to the first payment If completion occurs on the 5th, interest is calculated from the 5th to the end of the month and then added to the first payment The 'Amount of each instalment' section of the mortgage illustration sets out a first payment assuming a mortgage completes on the 1st of the following month. A customer’s first monthly payment may be different as it will depend on when the loan starts. We write to all customers when the mortgage starts to tell them when we will collect their first and subsequent payments.

We write to all customers when the mortgage starts to tell them when we will collect their first and subsequent payments. Interest Only expandable section The maximum loan amount available on interest only is 75% loan to value (LTV) (or for sale of mortgaged property (SOMP) main residence 50%, 60% or 75% depending on the minimum equity requirement). On part interest only/part capital and interest repayment customers can borrow up to 85% LTV with the balance on capital and interest repayment. Check the maximum loan on interest only for all repayment plans, including Sale of Mortgaged Property (SOMP) repayment plans, using the interest only calculator. All loans arranged where the capital element is not included in the monthly payment, including those that are part capital and interest repayment, part interest only, must have a plan in place to repay the capital at the end of the term. This includes new loans, further advances and product transfers. As a responsible lender, it is important for us to see evidence of the repayment plan for interest only mortgages so documents relating to the repayment plan must be received before a new mortgage offer can be considered. The repayment plan must cover the whole amount of interest only. This information is only a guide. A mortgage offer will only be issued once we have confirmed that the evidence supplied meets our criteria. Bonus There is a minimum income requirement for this repayment plan to be available: Sole applicant with an income of £75,000 or more Joint applicants where one applicant has an income of £75,000 or more, or where the combined income of both applicants is £100,000 or more. e.g. this could be £60k and £40k, therefore no applicant has an income of £75,000 or more but together their income is £100,000 or more The income requirement is calculated on the total of Basic, Overtime, Bonus and Commission for employed applicants or the latest year's income for self-employed customers. The amount of this repayment vehicle which can be used is assessed by: An annual bonus figure is calculated from the payslips provided as evidence Where bonus is paid annually the average of the bonus received in the last 2 years is used 30% of this bonus figure is then multiplied by the term of the mortgage required for the amount of Interest Only lending available There is an expectation that the customer will make periodic lump sum repayments to reduce the amount outstanding during their Interest Only mortgage and it is important the customer understands this,

however Early Repayment Charges would apply as normal where any overpayment concession is exceeded Where any Bonus is to be used as a repayment plan no bonus income earned by any customer will be used in the affordability assessment Lending Into Retirement - the term of any Interest Only lending must not exceed the lower of the Anticipated Retirement Age or Maximum Working Age of 70 where Bonus is being used as a Repayment Plan. The term can run up to 364 days past the lower of the ARA / MWA of 70. Evidence of bonus income is required: If received monthly the latest 3 payslips. If received quarterly, the latest 4 bonus payslips If received half yearly then previous 2 payslips showing bonus payment If received annually then previous 2 years payslips showing bonus payment An average value should be calculated and used Bonus slip must show applicant & employer name, pay date and gross bonus amount. Cash There is a minimum income requirement for this repayment plan to be available: Sole applicant with an income of £75,000 or more Joint applicants where one applicant has an income of £75,000 or more, or where the combined income of both applicants is £100,000 or more. e.g. this could be £60k and £40k, therefore no applicant has an income of £75,000 or more but together their income is £100,000 or more The income requirement is calculated on the total of Basic, Overtime, Bonus and Commission for employed applicants or the latest year's income for self-employed customers.

Important points on the assessment: We are not providing advice on your customer's repayment plan(s) or making any guarantee that their plan(s) will be sufficient to repay the outstanding balance (capital) at the end of the mortgage term. Your customer should review their plan(s) regularly during the term of their mortgage to make sure it is on track to repay the outstanding balance. Periodically, we will ask your customer to provide evidence of their repayment plan(s). If your customer is unable to satisfy us that their repayment plan(s) remains on track to repay the outstanding balance on their mortgage, we may ask your customer to transfer some or all of their mortgage onto a capital and interest repayment basis. Please remember it is your customer's responsibility to ensure they have sufficient funds to repay their outstanding balance at the end of the mortgage term. If they are unable to do so, their home may be repossessed to repay the outstanding balance. Important points on repayment plans: Repayment plans CANNOT be accepted if they include the name of anyone NOT named on the mortgage.

Republic of Ireland citizens do not need to apply under the EU Settlement Scheme and have automatic permanent right to reside in the UK (no proof of permanent right to reside is required for ROI citizens). Proof of permanent right to reside could be verified to one of the following: An immigration status 'share code' - customers who can view their immigration status online at gov.uk can provide a share code which lasts for 30 days and we can use to view their immigration status e.g. settled or pre-settled status.

Biometric Residence Permit showing 'indefinite' rights to remain (this includes 'indefinite leave to remain', 'indefinite leave to enter' or 'no time limit’). Letter from the Home Office confirming indefinite right to remain in the UK. When an application has one customer who has lived in the UK for more than 5 years, or meets the minimum income requirement above, or is a maximum 75% LTV then there is no requirement for the customer(s) to hold a particular type of visa or to have a minimum remaining visa validity. ‘Lived in the UK for more than 5 years …’ means lived in the UK for at least the latest 5 years, but the customer may have spent period(s) aboard within the last 5 years. We will use data provided by the credit reference agencies to determine if a customer has lived in the UK for more than 5 years. Alternatively we can accept proof from the customer e.g. a bank statement, HMRC tax notification, Local Authority Tax Bill or utility bill dated over 5 years ago. To calculate the income of £75,000 or £100,000 we will include the total of all earned incomes or the latest year’s income for self employed customers. On Shared Equity and Shared Ownership schemes, to determine if the <=75% loan to value (LTV) criteria has been met, the percentage LTV is calculated as the loan amount against the value of the customer's equity share. (On Shared Equity applications this differs to the LTV used for selecting from the product range which is the loan amount against the total purchase price). Applications from non-UK nationals holding diplomatic immunity are not acceptable. Non UK Nationals expandable section Applications can be considered for non-UK nationals up to 95% loan to value (LTV): If a next step message shows ‘Proof of permanent right to reside in the UK is required for at least one applicant’ we can proceed with proof that the customer (or any customer on a joint application) has permanent right to reside, OR proof that the customer (or any customer on a joint application) has lived in the UK for more than 5 years. Otherwise the loan to value would have to be reduced to 75% LTV to proceed. Permanent right to reside can include: As part of the EU Settlement Scheme EEA, EU and Swiss citizens, living in the UK by 31 December 2020 can apply to continue to live in the UK after 30 June 2021 and will receive one of two statuses which are both acceptable: Settled status (awarded where they have lived in UK for at least 5 years and also known as 'indefinite leave to remain under the EU Settlement Scheme').

Sub Sales & Back to Back transactions expandable section Sub-sales and back-to-back transactions are not acceptable. A sub-sale occurs when a property is bought and then sold on within six months, i.e. the borrower is buying the property from someone who has themselves bought the property less than six months before. The date of registration at the Land Registry is how we determine the length of ownership. This means that the current vendor must have owned the property for at least six months before we can accept an application to purchase that property. A back-to-back transaction is a type of sub-sale where the intervening seller buys from the original seller and sells on to the borrower on the same day or within a few days. We also regard as sub-sales, cases where the seller acquires the freehold (or superior leasehold) title to the property, which they then immediately sell on to the borrower by the grant to them of a lease (or sub-lease). The following cases are exceptions where it is acceptable for the property to be sold on within six months of acquisition by the seller. Where sales are by: A personal representative of the registered proprietor; or An institutional mortgagee exercising its power of sale; or A receiver, trustee-in-bankruptcy or liquidator; or A developer or builder selling a property acquired under a part-exchange scheme. A registered Housing Provider (Housing Association) exercising a power of sale. We will also accept inherited properties where the applicant is a beneficiary but has not owned the property for 6 months. Applications where the applicant is not a beneficiary of the inherited property and the beneficiary has owned the property for less than 6 months are not acceptable and must be declined. The conveyancer will be responsible for ensuring the application meets the acceptable criteria.

Back to top Income, employment and affordability Affordability, LTI and Income Multiples expandable section Halifax use affordability as a way of assessing how much they will lend. Where the loan requested is above the maximum loan available from our affordability calculation the loan amount should be reduced to proceed or the application will be declined. Please refer to our affordability calculator. PLEASE NOTE: The affordability calculator will give a guide to the amount we would be willing to lend however, as no credit search is carried out please be aware that this amount is subject to change once the Decision in Principle (DIP) is keyed. When calculating affordability, the following Loan to Income (LTI) caps also apply. These can be used to calculate the maximum loan that would be available based on income but these are caps and the actual maximum loan could be lower and can be impacted by loan to value and credit score. Income LTV Loans <=£750K Loans >£750K Income <£40K LTV 0 - 95% Loans <=£750K 4.49x Loans >£750K N/A Income £40K - <£50K LTV 0 - 85% 85.01 - 95% Loans <=£750K 4.75x 4.49x Loans >£750K N/A Income £50K - £75K LTV 0 - 75% 75.01 - 85% 85.01 - 95% Loans <=£750K 5.00x 5.00x 4.49x Loans >£750K N/A Income >£75K - £125K LTV 0 - 75% 75.01 - 85% 85.01 - 90% 90.01 - 95% Loans <=£750K 5.50x 5.00x 4.75x (loan <=£500K) 4.49x (loan >£500K - <=£750K) 4.49x Loans >£750K 5.50x 5.00x N/A N/A Income >£125K LTV 0 - 85% 85.01% - 90% 90.01 - 95% Loans <=£750K 5.50x 4.75x (loan <=£500K) 4.49x (loan >£500K - <=£750K) 4.49x Loans >£750K 5.50x N/A N/A First time buyer Boost Income LTV LTI Income £50K+ LTV 0 - 90% LTI 5.50x Income £50K+

Not available on shared equity or shared ownership schemes. For applications with any element of self-employed income please refer to the standard LTI table. For a small number of applications the overall credit profile may restrict the LTI applied to 5.00x rather than 5.50x shown, or the level of credit score may mean standard LTIs will apply. Please note: If the loan is for an Affordable Housing scheme (Shared Equity or Shared Ownership) then a scheme max LTI of 4.49x would apply. If there is any element of self-employed income on an application and the application income is up to £75k, a maximum LTI of 4.49x will apply. For loans where the application income >£75k, and there is any element of self employed income, the normal 5.50x maximum LTI applies up to 75% LTV. For loans >£500,000 to £750,000 of 85.01% to 95% LTV and for loans >£750,000 to £1m of 75.01% to 85% LTV a 4.00x LTI will apply. For like for like remortgage customers with no additional borrowing, who receive employed income only, up to 75% loan to value (LTV) and subject to credit score a 5.50x LTI will apply where the standard LTI would normally be below this level. A maximum LTI of 4.49x will still apply for remortgages on an Affordable Housing scheme (Shared Equity or Shared Ownership). The level of credit score achieved and overall credit profile may restrict the LTI applied; this may be restricted to 4.49x, to 5.00x rather than 5.50x shown and if income >£75k and loan >£500k where 4.49x shows this may be restricted to 4.00x. A different maximum LTI may sometimes apply as a result of the particular product selected. A property’s Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating is used in our affordability calculations allowing us to reflect a more tailored view of energy costs. A customer whose property has a higher EPC rating (e.g. A/B) will generally have lower energy costs than those with a lower EPC rating (F/G) on like-for-like use. For properties with an A/B EPC rating you may see a small increase in the maximum loan amount available and for properties with an F/G EPC rating a small decrease. There is no change to the maximum loan available for properties with a C, D or E EPC rating or where the EPC is unknown. For some customers we may make a deduction within our affordability calculation to allow for financial planning commitments the customer may have going forward. Within our affordability calculation we may apply an affordability adjustment for some contractors to take into account likely business expenses. In some circumstances we may deduct credit commitments as ongoing in our affordability calculation even when customers have declared

an intention to repay these. If the maximum loan available is reduced as a result then the loan amount must be reduced to proceed. When calculating affordability on interest only loans, Halifax will take into account the monthly premiums payable for the relevant repayment vehicle i.e. existing endowment or new or existing ISA. Please ensure the premium(s) is specified at both DIP and full application. Affordability must also include future changes to income and expenditure. Where the maximum loan available is below that requested there may be the option to extend the term (up to retirement) or extend term into retirement (subject to evidence of adequate retirement income). Please note, if the maximum loan available is reduced due to income not being evidenced at the declared level then the loan amount must be reduced accordingly. Only in the below scenarios may we consider a loan amount above the maximum loan from our affordability model: Existing Halifax mortgage customers with no increase in in loan amount or loan to value (LTV) compared with their current mortgage (see Existing Customers). There is additional income, not previously considered, that is expected for the life of the mortgage and can be evidenced in line with our requirements.

Commitments and outgoings expandable section Important reminders: Accuracy of keying It is very important that all commitments are keyed accurately so we can make an accurate affordability assessment. Please ensure you are familiar with the full list of commitment types that need to be keyed and how different commitments are treated, as shown in the table below You should have a thorough conversation with the customer around all their commitments/outgoings and it is recommended that you ask the customer to provide a copy of their credit report from the credit reference agencies to ensure all commitments are included Only if there are no commitments should ‘None’ be selected from the system dropdown list Please include any additional commitments that have been applied as a credit entry with credit reference agencies/bureaus e.g. mobile phone contracts Commitments to be repaid on or before completion Commitments to be repaid on or before completion must still be keyed and you should select ‘Yes’ for ‘Intend to Repay on Completion’. This includes the existing mortgage on a remortgage application Commitments should only be marked as to be repaid where the customer advises it is their definite intention to repay these by completion, this appears plausible given the amount of the payments required and remaining term of the commitment, and you are satisfied they have adequate means to repay these commitments e.g. from available savings or regular income Where commitments are keyed as to be repaid a special condition on the mortgage offer will state the mortgage has been assessed on the basis of the declared intention to repay these commitments and it is the customer responsibility to ensure that these commitments are repaid. Completion takes place on the

condition that such repayment takes place If any commitments were recently repaid but may still be shown on credit reference agencies/bureau information these commitments should be keyed and marked as ‘Yes’ for ‘Intend to Repay on Completion’ If repaying part of an outstanding commitment, then it must be split and keyed as two commitments: one to be repaid and one to remain For all loans above 85% loan to value (LTV) – and for any other applications where we decide that it is prudent – we will deduct commitments as ongoing even where the customer has declared an intention to repay these at or before completion. The loan amount must be affordable with these commitments deducted as remaining Payslips Please check if a customer’s payslips show any deductions that should be keyed as commitments e.g. student loans, child care vouchers or salary sacrifice loan schemes (e.g. cars) Keying hints Where keying commitments with no definitive ‘End Date’ key a likely end date For commitments with a monthly payment and no total outstanding balance key the balance as an annual commitment i.e. 12 x monthly payment Financial dependants - please see our Dependants section for the definition of child and adult dependants Adverse credit history - please see Adverse Credit for guidance on how to answer these application questions Commitment types to be keyed: Loans Loans Commitment type Notes Commitment type Hire purchase Notes Include any car lease or Personal Contract Purchase (PCPs) Commitment type Loan Notes Include any secured or unsecured loans Include as a loan any monthly payment to a Debt Management Plan/IVA Commitment type Buy now pay later Notes Include any deferred payment credit (DPC) e.g. pay in 3 or 4 payments as well as longer term buy now pay later options If the customer is still in the payment free period key what the monthly payment will be once these commence Commitment type Interest free loan Notes Include any retailer loans e.g. furniture Commitment type Student loan Notes If a customer advises that they have not yet started making any payments this does not need to be included, but if they are or are about to start payments, then this should be keyed Please check if a customer’s payslips show a student loan is being repaid and should be keyed as a commitment When a student loan commitment is keyed it will be deducted in our affordability calculation, even if it is selected as being repaid upon completion Cards & other credit Cards & other credit Commitment type Notes Commitment type Credit card Notes Key the current outstanding balance and monthly payment being made by the customer 5% of the outstanding balance is taken as a monthly commitment even if the customer declares that they are currently making a lower payment If your customer clears their balance in full each month, key the monthly payment to be the same as the outstanding balance and select ‘No’ for ‘Intend to Repay on Completion’ Include any store cards Commitment

If the gross rental income received is below 125% of the BTL mortgage payments the shortfall will automatically be deducted as a commitment in our affordability assessment If an existing residential mortgage is being remortgaged/converted to a BTL then key a residential mortgage as being repaid and a new BTL mortgage commitment as to remain with the new balance/payment that will apply upon completion For any other ‘residential’ mortgaged properties to remain in the background an assumed running cost will be deducted within the affordability assessment Commitment type Ground rent Notes If purchasing a leasehold property you must tick ‘Yes’ to ‘Do you intend to purchase a flat?’ Under Commitment type you will then be able to key the service charge and/or ground rent amounts Key £1 if no fee applies At Decision in Principle stage if the commitments have not been keyed, as not known, we will use an assumed value for these in our affordability calculation, which may mean that at Full Application when the true details are keyed under the property details page, this could affect the loan amount we are willing to lend When a full application is keyed and the service charge/ground rent keyed under the property details, we will use the higher of the value from the commitments screen or property details screen, so there is no need to amend/delete the details keyed under the credit commitments as

Completion takes place on the condition that such repayment takes place If any commitments were recently repaid but may still be shown on credit reference agencies/bureau information these commitments should be keyed and marked as ‘Yes’ for ‘Intend to Repay on Completion’ If repaying part of an outstanding commitment, then it must be split and keyed as two commitments: one to be repaid and one to remain For all loans above 85% loan to value (LTV) – and for any other applications where we decide that it is prudent – we will deduct commitments as ongoing even where the customer has declared an intention to repay these at or before completion. The loan amount must be affordable with these commitments deducted as remaining Please check if a customer’s payslips show any deductions that should be keyed as commitments e.g. student loans, child care vouchers or salary sacrifice loan schemes (e.g. cars) Where keying commitments with no definitive ‘End Date’ key a likely end date For commitments with a monthly payment and no total outstanding balance key the balance as an annual commitment i.e. 12 x monthly payment Financial dependants - please see our Dependants section for the definition of child and adult dependants Adverse credit history - please see Adverse Credit for guidance on how to answer these application questions Commitment types to be keyed: Commitment type Notes Commitment type Hire purchase Notes Include any car lease or Personal Contract Purchase (PCPs) Commitment type Loan Notes Include any secured or unsecured loans Include as a loan any monthly payment to a Debt Management Plan/IVA Commitment type Buy now pay later Notes Include any deferred payment credit (DPC) e.g. pay in 3 or 4 payments as well as longer term buy now pay later options If the customer is still in the payment free period key what the monthly payment will be once these commence Commitment type Interest free loan Notes Include any retailer loans e.g. furniture Commitment type Student loan Notes If a customer advises that they have not yet started making any payments this does not need to be included, but if they are or are about to start payments, then this should be keyed Please check if a customer’s payslips show a student loan is being repaid and should be keyed as a commitment When a student loan commitment is keyed it will be deducted in our affordability calculation, even if it is selected as being repaid upon completion Commitment type Notes Commitment type Credit card Notes Key the current outstanding balance and monthly payment being made by the customer 5% of the outstanding balance is taken as a monthly commitment even if the customer declares that they are currently making a lower payment If your customer clears their balance in full each month, key the monthly payment to be the same as the outstanding balance and select ‘No’ for ‘Intend to Repay on Completion’ Include any store cards Commitment type Charge card Notes (See under Credit card)

Commitment type Overdraft Notes Key the current outstanding balance and monthly payment being made by the customer 5% of the outstanding balance is taken as a monthly commitment even if the customer declares that they are currently making a lower payment If your customer clears their balance in full each month, key the monthly payment to be the same as the outstanding balance and select ‘No’ for ‘Intend to Repay on Completion’ Commitment type Mail order Notes Key the monthly payment and balance as confirmed by the customer Commitment type Notes Commitment type Child care Notes Include any nursery costs, childminder costs, child care vouchers and before/after school clubs Please check if a customer’s payslips show child care vouchers which should be keyed as a commitment Commitment type Maintenance Notes Include any payments for an ex-partner or dependent children who are not living with the customer Commitment type School fees Notes Key the monthly fees amount as confirmed by the customer Commitment type Notes Commitment type Mortgage Notes On Remortgages the existing mortgage to be replaced with our mortgage must be keyed as a commitment with ‘Yes’ for ‘Intend to Repay’; under source of funds select other and type ‘this mortgage’ A mortgage ‘type’ must be completed for any mortgage commitment which will usually be either ‘Residential’, or ‘Buy to Let’ if the property is already let or is to be let For any Buy to Let (BTL) mortgages please also key the rental income received under ‘Other income’ in the customer’s income section. If the gross rental income received is below 125% of the BTL mortgage payments the shortfall will automatically be deducted as a commitment in our affordability assessment If an existing residential mortgage is being remortgaged/converted to a BTL then key a residential mortgage as being repaid and a new BTL mortgage commitment as to remain with the new balance/payment that will apply upon completion For any other ‘residential’ mortgaged properties to remain in the background an assumed running cost will be deducted within the affordability assessment Commitment type Ground rent Notes If purchasing a leasehold property you must tick ‘Yes’ to ‘Do you intend to purchase a flat?’ Under Commitment type you will then be able to key the service charge and/or ground rent amounts Key £1 if no fee applies At Decision in Principle stage if the commitments have not been keyed, as not known, we will use an assumed value for these in our affordability calculation, which may mean that at Full Application when the true details are keyed under the property details page, this could affect the loan amount we are willing to lend When a full application is keyed and the service charge/ground rent keyed under the property details, we will use the higher of the value from the commitments screen or property details screen, so there is no need to amend/delete the details keyed under the credit commitments as they will not be counted twice Commitment type Service charge Notes (See

We will use assumed values for the following within our affordability assessment which means the following do not need to be keyed as commitments: Council Tax Utility bills e.g. water or energy TV Licence Insurance Travel costs Motor maintenance and repair Internet and multimedia Clothing Household shopping e.g. food If a customer does advise they are paying more for any of these commitments than an average customer would, then you should key these in as a commitment under ‘other’. Contractors expandable section Where a customer's income comes from a contract and they are not employed on a permanent basis they are classed as a contractor. This will include individuals who are self-employed and pay their own tax, those who are employed via an umbrella company who deduct their tax and people who are essentially employed but on a fixed/short term contract e.g. 12 months. Contractors can be treated as self-employed or employed for income verification purposes: Self Employed Treat as Self Employed if: The customer pays their own tax, OR Has more than 1 contract, OR Has set up a limited company and employs other contractors. Income is confirmed as standard for self-employed customers. Employed Treat as Employed if: Tax is paid by the company they work for (or they are employed via an umbrella company who deduct tax) OR Contractors who earn more than £500 per day or £75k per annum, OR are an IT contractor on any income, can be treated as employed irrespective if the customer pays their own tax, or classes themselves as self-employed. (The only exception to this is where a customer has more than one contract or they have set up a limited company and employs other contractors, in which case they should be treated as self-employed). Additionally to be treated as employed the customer must have either: 12 months or more continuous employment, with 6 months of the contract remaining, or 2 years continuous service (for the last 2 years as at the date of application) in the same type of employment When we are treating a contractor as employed for income verification these are our requirements: Contractor who pays own tax, or

--- CHUNK 37 ---
it is deducted by umbrella company (including IR35) Copy of latest contract and latest month’s payslip(s) required (or where payslips not issued latest month’s bank statement). Income to be used is the lower of the gross value of the contract or income calculated from payslip(s)/bank statement. Gross value of contract is calculated as daily rate on the contract x 5 days per week x 46 weeks per year (or hourly rate x 7 hours per day x 5 days per week x 46 weeks per year). Unless the contract states the actual hours/days worked are lower in which case use these figures. Income from payslip(s)/bank statement is calculated by multiplying the gross pay received to give an annual figure and then calculating the income based on a 46 week year (unless the contract states the actual weeks to be worked is lower in which case use these figures) e.g. multiply gross pay on a monthly payslip x 12, divide by 52 weeks and multiply by 46 (or average the gross pay on the weekly payslips and x 46). The total gross pay showing on umbrella payslips may be broken down by basic salary, commission, ‘additional taxable income', holiday pay etc. but as long as the contract confirms the contractor is paid via a daily rate, or hourly rate, the income does not need to be split into these separate elements and can all be keyed as basic salary. The lower of the two figures calculated is keyed as income and used for affordability. For customers who have set up a Limited Company or a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) the income evidence must be from the actual contracted employer not their own Limited Company. Contractors who are set up as a Limited Company may not be entitled to the full income of the contract where there is more than one shareholder. If there are other shareholders, and they are also to be named on the mortgage the income from the contract must be keyed for one customer only and no income from this contract can be keyed for the other applicants that are shareholders. If there are other shareholders, but they are not to be named on the mortgage the income should be keyed to reflect the customer share e.g. if 50% share then 50% of income should be used. Fixed/Short Term or Agency; tax is deducted by employer (not including IR35) The latest month’s payslip(s) must be used to evidence income, or latest 3 months’ payslips where other income is being used. Income from payslip is calculated by multiplying the gross pay received to give an annual figure and then calculating the income based on a 46 week year e.g. multiply gross pay on a monthly payslip x 12, divide by 52 weeks and multiply by 46 (or average the gross pay on the weekly payslips and x 46). Construction Industry Scheme Contractors (CIS) Applications from customers employed on a Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) Contract will be considered. Income should

--- CHUNK 38 ---
be evidenced using the latest 3 months consecutive payslips/invoices/statement along with corresponding bank statements (this could be from the same or different contracts). For example, if income in January, February and March is used, payslips/invoices/statement and corresponding bank statements must be for January, February and March. An average of the latest 3 months income should be used. This average amount should then be calculated based on a 46 week year e.g. multiply the average monthly pay x 12, divide by 52 weeks and multiply by 46. If no income is received or the customer is unable to provide both pieces of evidence of income, then ‘zero' income must be used for that month. Customers should be treated as self-employed if they pay their own tax or sub contract to more than one company. Zero hours contracts Applications from customers employed on a zero hours contract for over 12 months will be considered. Proof of all income in the last 12 months is required and that total income figure will be used. Probation Income from probationary employment is only used where the probationary period is part of a permanent contract. If the contract is purely probationary with the employer having the option to terminate the contract then this income cannot be used. It is important that probationary contracts are keyed accurately as follows: Where the applicant receives an offer of permanent employment and the contract states an initial probationary period e.g. three or six months, it should be keyed as 'permanent'. The income will be used in the affordability assessment. Where the applicant is offered a probationary contract, e.g. for three months, at the end of which the employer has the option to determine if a permanent contract will be offered, it should be keyed as ‘probationary'. The income will not be used in the affordability assessment. Professional Sports People Applications will be considered from Professional Sports People where either continuous employment of 12 months or more with 6 months of the contract remaining or 2 years continuous service (for the last two years as at the date of application) in the same type of employment can be confirmed. It is essential to establish that such individuals will have the ability to sustainably meet the monthly repayments as they near the end of their career or if their career should be ended abruptly due to injury.

or more with 6 months of the contract remaining or 2 years continuous service (for the last two years as at the date of application) in the same type of employment can be confirmed. It is essential to establish that such individuals will have the ability to sustainably meet the monthly repayments as they near the end of their career or if their career should be ended abruptly due to injury. Non-Sterling income (Foreign income) expandable section Non-sterling income can be accepted on purchase, remortgage, further advance (FA) and product transfer (PT) applications where a full affordability assessment is required. There is no minimum income level for non-sterling income to be used. For FAs/PTs non-sterling income can be used even if this was not included on the original purchase/remortgage application. We will accept income in the following five non-sterling currencies: US Dollar, Euro, Australian Dollar, Indian Rupee and Swiss Franc. The income types we’ll accept in non-sterling are employed basic salary, bonus, overtime and commission. Non-Sterling income cannot be accepted for ‘other income’ types. The only self-employed income acceptable in non-sterling is a partner of an LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) where the income can be keyed as self-employed and is verified to a letter from a finance director. We can include sterling income and non-sterling income on the same application, but we can only use one non-sterling currency on an application. Our website Mortgage affordability calculator will collect non-sterling incomes. This calculation is based on current exchange rates so when an application is made they may receive a different rate. When a Decision in Principle (DIP) is keyed the exchange rate to be used on that application will not then change, so the maximum loan available would not change due to any currency fluctuations. On our income screens you’ll see a new currency dropdown field and should key in the amount in the originating non-sterling currency, not the equivalent GBP amount. We’ll convert the income amount to GBP and apply a haircut of 20% (10% for bonus income) to cover any potential currency fluctuations. For income verification if payslips show the amount in the originating currency that is sufficient, but if they only show the converted GBP figure you should upload a compensation letter/remuneration statement in addition to the payslip(s). This document should show the income amount in the original currency which is what we will require. The compensation letter/remuneration statement can be a document that was sent directly to the customer by their employer, or received online but should show: Employer name Employee name (to match the application and payslip) Pay date Non-sterling currency using Income type e.g. salary or bonus clearly denoted. Payslips and any other documents must be in English language. All mortgage applicants must be UK residents which means they must have a ‘primary address’ in the UK. If someone’s primary address is outside the UK and they only have a correspondence address in the UK they are not a UK resident and a correspondence or

--- CHUNK 42 ---
family member’s address must not be declared as a primary address. A primary address does not need to be the address where someone spends the majority, or even a certain proportion, of their time e.g. they could spend the majority of their time at a foreign address due to working abroad but still have their primary address in the UK. This is not the same as ‘tax residency’ and we do not require customers meet any tax resident requirements. Non-sterling income is any income other than sterling received by a customer; non-sterling income converted to GBP to be paid into a UK bank account is still considered to be non-sterling income. Channel Islands/Crown Dependencies i.e. Jersey, Guernsey and Isle of Man plus Gibraltar and Falkland Islands should be treated as GBP and not non-sterling. Please note the amount of any ‘haircuts’ are subject to change. When non-sterling income is used two additional paragraphs will show on the Mortgage Illustration in the ‘Main features of loan’ and ‘Amount of each instalment’ sections. A letter will be sent to the customer after completion if the exchange rate goes down by more than 20% to advise them and confirm the support available if required. Q – Can you accept a contractor with a contract in a non-sterling currency? A – Yes, standard contractor income verification requirements would apply; a copy of the contract would be required together with bank statements or payslips to show the actual income being received. If bank statements only show the converted GBP amount received then to consider the application payslips or a compensation letter/remuneration statement would need to be available to show the amount received in the non-sterling currency Q – What is the treatment for seafarer contractors? A – The seafarers employment type refers to people who may work in various different roles on a seagoing vessel e.g. on a cruise ship or oil rig. Seafarers can be permanently employed but are most commonly contractors who are responsible for paying their own tax (which includes people who may say they are ‘tax exempt’) and for seafarer contractors the following treatment should be followed: Seafarer contractors – non-sterling income: Do they receive the equivalent of more than £500 per day or £75,000 per annum? Yes – follow our standard contractor policy A copy of the contract would be required together with bank statements or payslips to show the actual income being received. If bank statements only show the converted GBP amount received then to consider the application payslips or a compensation letter/remuneration statement would need to be available to show the amount received in the non-sterling currency No – the application cannot be considered Below the income level required to follow contractor policy they would need to be treated as self-employed, and we cannot consider self-employed income if non-sterling Seafarer contractors – sterling (GBP) income: Follow the standard treatment of contractor or self-employed given the customer’s employment basis/income level Q – Can you accept a self-employed customer where

--- CHUNK 43 ---
the business receives some income from overseas? A – If a company is not UK based we could not use self-employed income as we would be unable to evidence this income per our standard self-employed verification requirements. If a company is UK based we will use sterling income as evidenced on tax calculations (SA302s) and tax year overviews as normal ; if a ‘Foreign income’ amount is shown on the SA302 this amount should not be included in the income keyed Q – How do I key a bonus received in different currencies in each of the last 2 years e.g. previous year bonus in US$ and latest year in GBP? A – Only the latest year’s bonus could be used. The currency selected would be the currency of the latest year’s bonus. A two year average would be calculated using the latest year’s bonus amount and zero bonus for the previous year Q – Do customers need to be paid into a UK bank account? A – No, there is no specific requirement that income is paid into a UK bank account. All applicants must be UK residents as normal Q – Do payslips need to show UK tax being deducted?

Back to top Property questions and valuation Acceptable Property Types expandable section Each application will be assessed on its own merits although there are some property types which are specifically excluded. Do we lend on any property? No. We require experienced RICS (Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors) qualified surveyors to consider all the factors that may affect the suitability of a property to be mortgaged and whether or not it is readily saleable. Factors may include property construction, type, location, uses and environmental issues. Each case will be assessed on its own merits. Some property types such as houseboats, mobile homes and timeshares are specifically excluded. Do we lend on houses or flats/maisonettes made from precast reinforced concrete (PRC) that have been designated defective under the 1985 housing act? Generally not, unless the property has been repaired to a scheme that is approved by us. Flats/maisonettes which are designated defective PRC type are not acceptable. Do we lend on PRC properties that have been repaired but have no repair certificate? No. However, we will accept a ‘retrospective repair certificate’ confirming the repair has been undertaken to the standards laid down in the PRC Homes Repair Scheme or those accepted by us. The certificate must be in a format with wording required by us and prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced professional. Do we lend on non-traditionally constructed properties? Yes, subject to inspection and design. Each case is considered on its own merits. How big does the property have to be for a mortgage? Our general policy is to consider very property on its individual merits. We do not impose any size restrictions and no property is rejected solely on the grounds of size. A property must however meet the minimum criteria of being habitable, readily saleable and structurally sound. The property is situated above a shop/commercial property, is it suitable for a mortgage? There are no specific restrictions although some commercial uses may have a detrimental effect on saleability and every case is viewed on its own merits. The following guidance may be helpful: Any residential security must have a suitable access, which must

--- CHUNK 71 ---
not be through a business premises. Caution must be exercised where the title of the residential property has been separated from a larger title that includes commercial activity, particularly when this has been done specifically for the purpose of the proposed mortgage. This can sometimes lead to an unusual residential property that may suit the proposed applicants but would be more difficult to sell on the open market. The residential security must meet the general principles regarding saleability. The property must be self-contained, with its own private facilities and separate services. Do we lend on high rise flats? Every case is viewed on its own merits, subject to construction and saleability. Certain types e.g. large panel systems (LPS) have specific requirements. Do we lend on properties with short leases? For leasehold properties to be acceptable, there must be a minimum of 70 years unexpired on the term of the lease at the time of the mortgage application. Do we lend on houses or flats with solar panels/photo voltaic cells? We will not usually lend on blocks of leasehold flats where photo voltaic cells have been fitted, but there are some exceptions. Houses with leased solar panels are acceptable for lending providing the agreed lease is acceptable to us. This will be confirmed through the conveyancer or by checking our approved list. The valuer must be satisfied that the photo voltaic cells or solar panels have no impact on the structural integrity of the property and will be taken in to account when assessing value and saleability. Acceptable Property Types expandable section Each application will be assessed on its own merits although there are some property types which are specifically excluded. Do we lend on any property? No. We require experienced RICS (Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors) qualified surveyors to consider all the factors that may affect the suitability of a property to be mortgaged and whether or not it is readily saleable. Factors may include property construction, type, location, uses and environmental issues. Each case will be assessed on its own merits. Some property types such as houseboats, mobile homes and timeshares are specifically excluded. Do we lend on houses or flats/maisonettes made from precast reinforced concrete (PRC) that have been designated defective under the 1985 housing act? Generally not, unless the property has been repaired to a scheme that is approved by us. Flats/maisonettes which are designated defective PRC type are not acceptable. Do we lend on PRC properties that have been repaired but have no repair certificate? No. However, we will accept a ‘retrospective repair certificate’ confirming the repair has been undertaken to the standards laid down in the PRC Homes Repair Scheme or those accepted by us. The certificate must be in a format with wording required by us and prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced professional. Do we lend on non-traditionally constructed properties? Yes, subject to inspection and design. Each case is considered on its own merits. How big does the property have to be for

a mortgage? Our general policy is to consider very property on its individual merits. We do not impose any size restrictions and no property is rejected solely on the grounds of size. A property must however meet the minimum criteria of being habitable, readily saleable and structurally sound.

Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) expandable section On purchase applications valid EPC details for the property are always required. On remortgages if the property has a valid EPC this must be captured, but if the property does not have a valid EPC the remortgage application can still proceed. When property details are completed we will display on the EPC Details screen the latest EPC record to be used for the application. This EPC information comes from our database which is based on the Government EPC register. Please check the EPC showing is valid (within 10 years) and is the latest EPC available for the property. If the latest EPC is not showing details will need to be keyed: Current Energy Efficiency Rating Potential Energy Efficiency Rating EPC Certificate/Reference Number EPC date field (‘Valid Until’ for England/Wales/NI or ‘Date of Certificate’ for Scotland). The screen has a ‘Check EPC Register’ button to open the Government register to see if a new EPC record shows, otherwise please refer to the customer who may need to speak to the agent/vendor or developer/builder to obtain the necessary information. For the purchase of new build properties an EPC may not be available, we will accept a Predicted Energy Assessment (PEA) or Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) rating and these details should be keyed. On remortgage applications if an EPC does not exist for the property EPC details do not need to be manually keyed. If EPC details are manually keyed and we request proof of the EPC this must be uploaded with the other verification documents e.g. EPC Certificate, PEA/SAP document for new build or where a property is ‘exempt’ a completed exemptions template (PDF, 48KB). A property’s Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating is used in our affordability calculations allowing us to reflect a more tailored view of energy costs. A customer whose property has a higher EPC rating (e.g. A/B) will generally have lower energy costs than those with a lower EPC rating (F/G) on like-for-like use. For properties with an A/B EPC rating you may see a small increase in the maximum loan amount available and for properties with an F/G EPC rating a small decrease. There is no change to the maximum loan available for properties with a C, D or E EPC rating or where the EPC is unknown.

EWS1 and Cladding expandable section Due to provisions laid down under the Building Safety Act 2022 we will not require any further information on buildings containing 5 storeys and above in England and these applications can proceed as normal. For these properties we will ask the purchaser’s conveyancer to gather information relating to the current leaseholder as there may be some situations where a leaseholder may have to contribute to cladding remediation. These cases will be referred by the purchaser’s conveyancer for us to review further. All high rise buildings in Wales (5 storeys or 11 meters and above) are eligible for remediation. We will not require any further information and these applications can proceed as normal. For Scotland & Northern Ireland (all buildings) and buildings 4 storeys and below in England and Wales in line with RICS guidance to valuers we may ask for an EWS1 before a valuation figure can be provided. It is the responsibility of the building owner and/or its agent (in Scotland individual customers have to source the EWS1 form) as the responsible person to: Confirm that an external wall system (EWS)

For help with purchasing a property in Scotland, you can view further support please see Scottish Properties. Valuation Reports & Surveys expandable section Can my clients appeal the Valuation? Yes they can, please view our appeals process for more information. How long does it take for the valuation inspection to be carried out? These are for guidance purposes only and depending on other factors such as property type and size they may vary. For a Level 1 Valuation it will take approximately 30-40 minutes. A Level 2 Survey and Valuation will take approximately 90 minutes to 2 hours. Where can I find information on your valuation fees? Details of our valuation fees. Will the Surveyor need access to the property? If the valuation is a Level 1 Valuation or Level 2 Survey and Valuation then access will be required to the property and arrangements will be made directly with the occupier or agent. Do you offer level 3 Building Surveys? No. Your client can find a surveyor to complete this for them, we do not offer Building Surveys. Why are some instructions panelled? E.surv are our surveyor of choice and wherever possible will carry out the valuation instruction. However where e.surv do not have coverage or to ensure we meet the needs of your clients, the instruction may be panelled to a member of e.surv's Valuation Panel who are administered by e.surv. Both e.surv and the valuation panel follow the same lender guidance provided by us and are audited on a regular basis. Why does my client need to sign the Terms of Engagement documentation you have sent them? Terms of Engagement are issued in order to reflect accurately the scope of the service to be provided so that your client is in a position to fully understand what service the firm is providing to them. As such, a report cannot be released to them until the Terms of Engagement have been read, signed and returned by the client. Does my client need to provide the Surveyor with any paperwork when they visit the property? No, the surveyor will have all the information they need. Does my client need to be present? No, as long as there is a person over the age of 18 that can let the surveyor in. Alternatively the surveyor can collect the key from a neighbour or estate agent for example. Will the surveyor need access to the loft? For Level 1 Valuation inspections access is generally not needed, although there may be occasions when the surveyor will want to have

--- CHUNK 82 ---
access to complete their investigations. Access will always be required for the Level 2 Survey. Is a copy of the Valuation Report sent to the solicitor? E.surv surveyors are unable to release valuation reports directly to solicitors. If your client requires a copy by post, fax or email then they must request it directly from e.surv. Please be aware that we cannot send reports to solicitors or any other third party at your client's request. We can only issue the report directly to your client. Can I discuss an existing case with e.surv if I am not named on the application? E.surv are only able to discuss valuation instructions with an applicant named on the case. The named applicant can authorise us to discuss the case with another party by calling and setting up a specific agreed security password. Does the Valuation Report contain an insurance or rebuild valuation figure? No, an insurance figure is generally not provided on the report. Your client can obtain an insurance figure independently by visiting the Association of British Insurers (ABI) website. The ABI website has a residential rebuilding cost calculator. Your client will be required to register with the website but can then log in and obtain a rebuilding/insurance figure for free. What kind of comparable research on properties is used by the surveyor? Our reports are provided in accordance with the RICS Valuation – Professional Standards. When preparing reports, valuers compare evidence of recent sales in order to provide an opinion of value at a specific point in time. Ideally comparables include properties within the immediate locality offering similar accommodation and style to that of the subject property. However, comparable evidence need not be identical and it is sometimes the case that no direct comparable evidence is available. In such cases the valuer will use their experience to adjust for any variances in matters such as size, condition and specific location or geographical appeal. Valuers consider a wide range of comparable evidence and their research is thorough. Details of properties currently on the market and valuations provided by estate agents do not relate to realised sale values. Also, estate agent marketing appraisals are prepared for a different purpose than mortgage valuation or survey reports. Such information cannot be considered in lieu of comparable sales evidence. My client has received an encrypted mail from e.surv, how do they open it? All emails containing sensitive and confidential information are sent using the Symantec secure email encryption service. The initial email will contain a link which takes your client to the Symantec service so they can register as a new user, including creating their own password. Symantec is not compatible with mobile devices therefore a desktop or laptop computer will be required to open the email (PDF, 547kB). Will my client be charged a fee if the valuation is cancelled? A fee is not charged if the surveyor does not either visit the property or accept the instruction. If the surveyor visits the property and

--- CHUNK 83 ---
finds it unsuitable they will complete a Level 1 Property Risk Assessment and confirm that they cannot give a valuation figure. They will point out that the property is unsuitable for lending and provide the reason. The valuation fee is payable in these circumstances. Will you report on the property's condition? Level 1 Valuations are based on a limited inspection of the property highlighting only those items that are deemed to have a material impact on value. It is prepared in order for us to make an assessment of our loan to your client. It is not a survey of condition and is not designed to list individual property defects. It should not be relied on for their buying decision. Level 2 Survey and Valuations report on specific condition matters and other issues to the extent outlined in the individual Terms of Engagement, which could affect a decision to buy. We base our lending decisions on the valuation aspects only. Why might my client need a specialist report? Occasionally serious or potentially serious defects are found. The surveyor may not be able to provide a valuation without further investigation so a Specialist Report is requested. Serious defects warranting further investigation may include dry rot, structural movement, trees and drains but this is not an exhaustive list. If a Structural Engineers Report is required this should be a focused report on the specific defect(s) referred to e.g. cracking, structural movement, subsidence, roof deflection, trees potentially causing damage, suspected drain failure etc. General reports on condition such as: Building Surveys, RICS Homebuyer reports etc. are not acceptable. The report must be addressed to our applicants and not the vendor, must detail the property address and must be signed off by a professional with the required qualifications, either: Structural Engineer (with qualification M.I.C.E, F.I.C.E, IM.I Struct E, M.I. Struct E or F.I Struct E.) Corporate Building/Corporate Structural Engineer (with qualification M.A.S.I., F.A.S.I, MBEng., FBEng., M.C.I.O.B. or F.C.I.O.B) Chartered Building Surveyor (with qualification MRICS or FRICS). For timber/dampness specialist reports the following qualifications are acceptable: Property Care Association (PCA) - including specialists with a PCA recognized qualification: Certificated Surveyor in Remedial Treatments (CSRT) [widely now re-named. Certificated Surveyor of Timber & Dampness in Buildings (CSTDB)] or for dampness only Certificated Surveyor of Dampness in Buildings (CSDB). Reports can also be considered from Non-PCA members provided any works are covered by an insurance. For drainage reports the following qualifications are acceptable: Member of the Institute of Civil Engineers (MICE/FICE) Specialist drainage contractor. Valuation Reports & Surveys expandable section Can my clients appeal the Valuation? Yes they can, please view our appeals process for more information. How long does it take for the valuation inspection to be carried out? These are for guidance purposes only and depending on other factors such as property type and size they may vary. For a Level 1 Valuation it will take approximately 30-40 minutes. A Level 2 Survey and Valuation will take approximately 90 minutes to 2 hours. Where can

--- CHUNK 84 ---
I find information on your valuation fees? Details of our valuation fees. Will the Surveyor need access to the property? If the valuation is a Level 1 Valuation or Level 2 Survey and Valuation then access will be required to the property and arrangements will be made directly with the occupier or agent. Do you offer level 3 Building Surveys? No. Your client can find a surveyor to complete this for them, we do not offer Building Surveys. Why are some instructions panelled? E.surv are our surveyor of choice and wherever possible will carry out the valuation instruction. However where e.surv do not have coverage or to ensure we meet the needs of your clients, the instruction may be panelled to a member of e.surv's Valuation Panel who are administered by e.surv. Both e.surv and the valuation panel follow the same lender guidance provided by us and are audited on a regular basis. Why does my client need to sign the Terms of Engagement documentation you have sent them? Terms of Engagement are issued in order to reflect accurately the scope of the service to be provided so that your client is in a position to fully understand what service the firm is providing to them. As such, a report cannot be released to them until the Terms of Engagement have been read, signed and returned by the client. Does my client need to provide the Surveyor with any paperwork when they visit the property? No, the surveyor will have all the information they need. Does my client need to be present? No, as long as there is a person over the age of 18 that can let the surveyor in. Alternatively the surveyor can collect the key from a neighbour or estate agent for example. Will the surveyor need access to the loft? For Level 1 Valuation inspections access is generally not needed, although there may be occasions when the surveyor will want to have access to complete their investigations. Access will always be required for the Level 2 Survey. Is a copy of the Valuation Report sent to the solicitor? E.surv surveyors are unable to release valuation reports directly to solicitors. If your client requires a copy by post, fax or email then they must request it directly from e.surv. Please be aware that we cannot send reports to solicitors or any other third party at your client's request. We can only issue the report directly to your client. Can I discuss an existing case with e.surv if I am not named on the application? E.surv are only able to discuss valuation instructions with an applicant named on the case. The named applicant can authorise us to discuss the case with another party by calling and setting up a specific agreed security password. Does the Valuation Report contain an insurance or rebuild valuation figure? No, an insurance figure is generally not provided on the report. Your client can obtain an insurance figure independently by visiting the Association of

--- CHUNK 85 ---
British Insurers (ABI) website. The ABI website has a residential rebuilding cost calculator. Your client will be required to register with the website but can then log in and obtain a rebuilding/insurance figure for free. What kind of comparable research on properties is used by the surveyor? Our reports are provided in accordance with the RICS Valuation – Professional Standards. When preparing reports, valuers compare evidence of recent sales in order to provide an opinion of value at a specific point in time. Ideally comparables include properties within the immediate locality offering similar accommodation and style to that of the subject property. However, comparable evidence need not be identical and it is sometimes the case that no direct comparable evidence is available. In such cases the valuer will use their experience to adjust for any variances in matters such as size, condition and specific location or geographical appeal. Valuers consider a wide range of comparable evidence and their research is thorough. Details of properties currently on the market and valuations provided by estate agents do not relate to realised sale values. Also, estate agent marketing appraisals are prepared for a different purpose than mortgage valuation or survey reports. Such information cannot be considered in lieu of comparable sales evidence. My client has received an encrypted mail from e.surv, how do they open it? All emails containing sensitive and confidential information are sent using the Symantec secure email encryption service. The initial email will contain a link which takes your client to the Symantec service so they can register as a new user, including creating their own password. Symantec is not compatible with mobile devices therefore a desktop or laptop computer will be required to open the email (PDF, 547kB). Will my client be charged a fee if the valuation is cancelled? A fee is not charged if the surveyor does not either visit the property or accept the instruction. If the surveyor visits the property and finds it unsuitable they will complete a Level 1 Property Risk Assessment and confirm that they cannot give a valuation figure. They will point out that the property is unsuitable for lending and provide the reason. The valuation fee is payable in these circumstances. Will you report on the property's condition? Level 1 Valuations are based on a limited inspection of the property highlighting only those items that are deemed to have a material impact on value. It is prepared in order for us to make an assessment of our loan to your client. It is not a survey of condition and is not designed to list individual property defects. It should not be relied on for their buying decision. Level 2 Survey and Valuations report on specific condition matters and other issues to the extent outlined in the individual Terms of Engagement, which could affect a decision to buy. We base our lending decisions on the valuation aspects only. Why might my client need a specialist report? Occasionally serious or potentially serious defects

Overpayments & Payment Holidays expandable section Overpayments Lump sum or regular overpayments can be made at any time. If early repayment charges apply to the product, refer to early repayment charges for more details. Payment holidays If your clients wish to take a payment holiday and if they meet criteria it may be possible for them to take up to a maximum of 6 months over the lifetime of their mortgage. One holiday is allowed every 3 years with a maximum of 2 months per instance. A payment holiday can be requested for any reason and each circumstance should be individually assessed using questioning skills to establish if this is the correct method to support the customer. It is very important that your client has not indicated they are in financial difficulty, and the purpose

--- CHUNK 92 ---
for the request is both reasonable and in their best interest. It is important to remember that a payment holiday is a short term solution for short term need. If your client does take a payment holiday they need to be aware that the interest usually charged will be added to the balance of the mortgage. Their account will be recalculated at the end of the payment holiday and written confirmation will be sent out approximately 2 weeks before their payment will restart. The monthly payment will be calculated at that time using the higher balance and spread throughout the remaining term. If they have any sub accounts on Interest Only they need to be aware that these balances will increase to cover the amount of accrued interest that has been added due to the missed payments. Therefore, they will need to check that their repayment plan is on track to repay this mortgage at the end of the term. Whilst your client has an active payment holiday, they will be ineligible to apply for a Further Advance or a Mortgage Review. They can only proceed with an application if they stop the payment holiday, or wait until it has ended. Criteria The mortgage must have been open for at least 12 months with no further borrowing in the last 6 months. The account must not be in arrears at the time of the application or have had any historic arrears on the account (in the last 12 months). The account must not have had any missed payments in the past 12 months. There must be no payment arrangement in force or have been within the last 6 months. The total debt on the mortgage must not exceed 75% at point of application; there will be the option for a revaluation (fee applicable). The mortgage property must not be on a Shared Ownership scheme. The mortgaged property must be the Main Residence, and is not rented out. Customer(s) must not currently be claiming on a Mortgage Repayments Insurance policy or be applying for, or be in receipt of, Income Support.

Porting Applications expandable section If an existing Halifax mortgage is repaid while an Early Repayment Charge (ERC) applies this charge will be due unless the amount on the existing product is ported to a new application, when the ERC will be waived. The ERC can also be waived without porting, if a new mortgage is being taken in the last 3 months of the ERC period. In a non-simultaneous sale and purchase scenario the ERC has to be paid but can be refunded as explained below. Please notify us when you submit any new application for an existing Halifax mortgage customer, by advising the colleague when making an initial call or by completing the Contact form (PDF, 35kB) held on our Literature page and uploading this. Please explain if the product is being ported or if not why so we can take the necessary actions. If a product is portable this is outlined in the original mortgage offer and supporting documentation. You cannot port a

--- CHUNK 94 ---
product onto a remortgage application from another lender, but can port to a remortgage of an unencumbered (mortgage free) property the customer already owns, where this will become their main residence. Where Halifax Standard Variable Rate is the reversionary rate which applies to the product being ported, it will continue to be the reversionary rate for the amount of the new mortgage which is on the ported product. Any extra amount borrowed on the new mortgage must be on a product from the current range and applicable scheme. The reversionary rate which applies to that product and the amount on it will be Halifax Homeowner Variable Rate. To port a product the new mortgage application must complete simultaneously with redemption of the current mortgage. The conveyancer must indicate a product is being ported when they obtain a redemption statement for the existing mortgage; the statement will then explain that the ERC does not need to be included in the redemption monies. If the amount to be ported to a new loan is lower than the amount currently on the product the ERC payable will be calculated on a pro rata basis. For example, if £100,000 of £200,000 on the existing product is being ported then 50% of the ERC would be charged. If the new mortgage application is completing simultaneously with redemption of the current mortgage only the partial ERC would need to be paid upon redemption. Within the last 3 months of an ERC period the product does not need to be ported to a new mortgage; as long as the new loan amount is not lower than the existing amount on the product with ERCs, a product from the new current range can be chosen for the new mortgage and the early repayment charge will be waived. Where a customer sells their property and repays their existing mortgage before they complete on a new purchase, they will incur any ERCs that apply. However, if they apply for a new mortgage with us within three months of repaying their existing mortgage, while they cannot port and would choose a new product from the current range at that time, once the new mortgage has completed we will process a refund of the ERC. This is a concession and it may not always be available. The new loan amount must not be lower than the amount previously on the product, or a partial refund of the ERC will be received on a pro rata basis. During the processing of the new application you should tell us where a refund of an ERC will be required or complete a Contact form (PDF, 35kB). You should also call us when the new mortgage completes so we can request the refund of the ERC is actioned. Buy to Let mortgage products cannot be ported onto non Buy to Let mortgages. To key to port a product on a new application: Make sure 'Existing Customer' has been chosen as 'Purchase Type' on Personal Details screen.

--- CHUNK 95 ---
On the Products selection screen complete 'Roll number' or 'Account Number' with the customer's existing mortgage account: The 'Roll number' is their original application roll number - if the final digit after the dash is a single digit remember to input a zero ahead of this e.g. for 9 key '09'; 10/12345678-9 is keyed as 101234567809 Or key 'Account Number' in a 14 digit format e.g. 10/12345678-9 should be keyed as 10123456780900 including a zero ahead of the final digit if this is a single digit and two zeros at the end to make 14 digits. Any products available to port will then show. Please ensure the customer's name, date of birth and address details are keyed correctly on the new application to exactly match the existing mortgage as shown in Mortgage Enquiry, for the portable product(s) to show available. Porting Applications expandable section If an existing Halifax mortgage is repaid while an Early Repayment Charge (ERC) applies this charge will be due unless the amount on the existing product is ported to a new application, when the ERC will be waived. The ERC can also be waived without porting, if a new mortgage is being taken in the last 3 months of the ERC period.

To port a product the new mortgage application must complete simultaneously with redemption of the current mortgage. The conveyancer must indicate a product is being ported when they obtain a redemption statement for the existing mortgage; the statement will then explain that the ERC does not need to be included in the redemption monies. If the amount to be ported to a new loan is lower than the amount currently on the product the ERC payable will be calculated on a pro rata basis. For example, if £100,000

--- CHUNK 96 ---
of £200,000 on the existing product is being ported then 50% of the ERC would be charged. If the new mortgage application is completing simultaneously with redemption of the current mortgage only the partial ERC would need to be paid upon redemption. Within the last 3 months of an ERC period the product does not need to be ported to a new mortgage; as long as the new loan amount is not lower than the existing amount on the product with ERCs, a product from the new current range can be chosen for the new mortgage and the early repayment charge will be waived. Where a customer sells their property and repays their existing mortgage before they complete on a new purchase, they will incur any ERCs that apply. However, if they apply for a new mortgage with us within three months of repaying their existing mortgage, while they cannot port and would choose a new product from the current range at that time, once the new mortgage has completed we will process a refund of the ERC. This is a concession and it may not always be available. The new loan amount must not be lower than the amount previously on the product, or a partial refund of the ERC will be received on a pro rata basis. During the processing of the new application you should tell us where a refund of an ERC will be required or complete a Contact form (PDF, 35kB). You should also call us when the new mortgage completes so we can request the refund of the ERC is actioned. Buy to Let mortgage products cannot be ported onto non Buy to Let mortgages. To key to port a product on a new application: Make sure 'Existing Customer' has been chosen as 'Purchase Type' on Personal Details screen. On the Products selection screen complete 'Roll number' or 'Account Number' with the customer's existing mortgage account: The 'Roll number' is their original application roll number - if the final digit after the dash is a single digit remember to input a zero ahead of this e.g. for 9 key '09'; 10/12345678-9 is keyed as 101234567809 Or key 'Account Number' in a 14 digit format e.g. 10/12345678-9 should be keyed as 10123456780900 including a zero ahead of the final digit if this is a single digit and two zeros at the end to make 14 digits. Any products available to port will then show. Please ensure the customer's name, date of birth and address details are keyed correctly on the new application to exactly match the existing mortgage as shown in Mortgage Enquiry, for the portable product(s) to show available.

OR A sitting tenant purchasing from their landlord (private or council) at a discounted price (minimum of 10% discount is required). This excludes Right to Buy. The tenant must have been subject to a tenancy agreement on the property for a minimum

of 1 year. The only relationships permitted for a concessionary purchase are (including vice versa): Parents, step-parents, adoptive parents. Applicant's children, step-children, half children, adopted children. Brothers and sisters, half brothers and sisters, step-brothers and sisters. Grandparents, step-grandparents. Grandchild, step-grandchild. Aunt/Uncle. Partners or ex-partners who are not co-habiting at the property. All family purchase transactions must provide vacant possession (the vendor must be moving out) on completion. In all cases the discount on the purchase price must be a minimum of 10% of the market value and must be a genuine discount (must not be subject to any future repayment, clawback or retained interest terms). For inherited properties where a beneficiary is purchasing the other beneficiaries share, this should be keyed as a concessionary purchase. The purchase price will be the amount required to buy out the other beneficiaries. Example: Mr Smith has died leaving the property valued at £200,000 to his two sons; therefore each beneficiary has a share of £100,000. Only one son wants the property and wishes to buy out the brother's shares. In this scenario, the purchase price would be £100,000 as the applicant already owns 50% of the property. A valuation must be instructed in all cases including properties in Scotland (retypes are not permitted). Note: As the application results can differ on these cases once the correct purchase price has been keyed, you must contact The Halifax Intermediary Processing Team for all applications for Concessionary Purchase. This will ensure correct underwriting of the case has been carried out at the time of application.

First Homes Scheme expandable section The Government First Homes scheme in England allows First Time Buyers (FTB) to purchase a New Build property at a discounted purchase price under a Resale Price Covenant (RPC). The discount (which will be a minimum 30%) must be passed on if the property is sold in the future. Key eligibility criteria for First Homes scheme: All applicants must be a First Time Buyer. Local Authorities may prioritise key workers, local residents and service personnel. In England only. New Build properties only. Maximum purchase price, after discount, is £250,000 (£420,000 in London). Discount typically 30% but Local Authorities can increase up to 50%. Customer maximum income of £80,000 (£90,000 in London). Mortgage criteria: Minimum 5% personal deposit based on discounted purchase price. First Homes scheme specific products must be selected (for remortgages Affordable Housing remortgage range applies). Mortgage must be on a capital and interest repayment basis, no interest only. Minimum 50% Loan to Value (LTV) based on discounted purchased price. Example: Full market valuation = £100,000 Discount of 30% (but could be higher) = £30,000 Discounted purchase price = £70,000 Customer deposit required = £3,500 (5% of £70,000) Maximum Loan = £66,500 LTV for product selection = 67% (£66,500 loan against £100,000 full market value). A 5% personal deposit is required in addition to any incentives from the builder. The loan amount together with any incentives and any product fee being added, cannot exceed 95% of the discounted purchase price. For product selection the percentage LTV used will be loan amount against the full market value (not discounted purchase price). On Halifax Intermediaries Online the ‘First Homes’ scheme should be selected on the Scheme screen and you will then be asked to key the percentage discount. On the Loan screen key the discounted purchase price. The customer should obtain an Authority to Proceed (ATP) from the Local Authority. A Decision In Principle (DIP) can be keyed before ATP has been obtained by selecting the new scheme and a full application should only be submitted after ATP has been granted. A Special Condition on the mortgage offer will state that an RPC will apply to the property. Affordable Housing Scheme Guidance Notes will be issued automatically to the conveyancer with the offer. Remortgages Remortgages of properties initially purchased under the First

--- CHUNK 107 ---
Homes scheme are accepted. Please select the First Homes scheme and key the percentage (%) discount applied when the property was originally purchased. On the Loan screen key the estimated property value after the percentage discount is applied e.g. if the estimated full market value is £250,000 and a 40% discount applied when the property was initially purchased key £150,000 as the estimated property value. Products should be selected from the Affordable Housing Remortgage range; the loan to value (LTV) for selecting the product is the loan amount against the full market value. Product transfer (PT) and further advance (FA) applications Please see the Product Finder within Mortgage Enquiry for the available products. The loan to value (LTV) for product selection will be the loan amount against the full value of the property. Further advance applications are not available until a mortgage has been open for 6 months. The maximum 85% LTV for FA applications is based on the loan amount against the property valuation after the percentage discount is applied.

A Special Condition on the mortgage offer will state that an RPC will apply to the property. Affordable Housing Scheme Guidance Notes will be issued automatically to the conveyancer with the offer. Remortgages Remortgages of properties initially purchased under the First Homes scheme are accepted. Please select the First Homes scheme and key the percentage (%) discount applied when the property was originally purchased. On the Loan screen key the estimated property value after the percentage discount is applied e.g. if the estimated full market value is £250,000 and a 40% discount applied when the property was initially purchased key £150,000 as the estimated property value. Products should be selected from the Affordable Housing Remortgage range; the loan to value (LTV) for selecting the product is the loan amount against the full market value. Product transfer (PT) and further advance (FA) applications Please see the Product Finder within Mortgage Enquiry for the available products. The loan to value (LTV) for product selection will be the loan amount against the full value of the property. Further advance applications are not available until a mortgage has been open for 6 months. The maximum 85% LTV for FA applications is based on the loan amount against the property valuation after the percentage discount is applied. We continue to accept RPC schemes which are not part of the First Homes initiative. Please see Resale Price Covenant (RPC) criteria.

Mortgage Prisoner expandable section Customers classed as Mortgage Prisoners by the FCA due to their current mortgage being held with a closed book lender may be able to remortgage to the Halifax. Applications will be subject to our criteria, credit scoring and affordability assessment. If a remortgage application passes our credit score but fails our affordability assessment we may still be able to consider the application. The customer must be remortgaging from a closed book lender and have received a

--- CHUNK 109 ---
letter from their existing lender stating they are classed as a Mortgage Prisoner. The remortgage application would need to meet the following criteria: A remortgage of the customer's main residence with no additional borrowing (excluding any fees). Maximum 75% loan to value (LTV). Interest Only lending is acceptable subject to verification of acceptable repayment plans for the whole amount of interest only per our normal criteria. The customer's new monthly payment must be no more than 5% higher than the current monthly payment. The mortgage cannot be on a Shared Equity or Shared Ownership scheme. The customer must not be in Financial Difficulty. Please see the definition of ‘Financial Difficulty'. If an Alternative Lending Proposal (ALP) application result is received this indicates the application has passed our credit score but failed the affordability assessment. If all of the above criteria are met please select the ‘Mortgage Prisoner' scheme in Halifax Intermediaries Online and submit the full application. You should complete and upload the Mortgage Prisoner form (PDF, 124kB) and all required documentation. Even if the above criteria are met the level of credit score achieved will be considered and the application will still be subject to a full review before we can confirm if we are able to proceed. It is important the customer has checked if there are any other financial interests registered against the property (for example if there is a second charge or charging order) and if so that these will either be removed or postponed so that Halifax has a first charge. In many cases due to the nature of the interest it will be clear from the outset that postponement is not possible and it will be necessary for the debt to the third party to be repaid on or before completion. If it becomes apparent that the Halifax mortgage cannot be registered as a first charge because of any third party interest in the property the new mortgage will not be able to proceed.

There are three firms of conveyancers who have been appointed to act for the Bank in these transactions and the appropriate conveyancer will be appointed based on property location: England & Wales – Enact Conveyancing Fax 0344 244 3376 Scotland – Aberdein Considine Fax 01244 585043 Northern Ireland – Wilson Nesbitt Fax 028 912 78199 The following should be noted: The customer will meet the cost of their conveyancer but we will meet the costs of the firm acting for the Bank. The customer must provide details of their conveyancer and be made aware that any offer made will be issued to the Bank's conveyancer and the customer's conveyancer will be contacted directly by the Bank's appointed firm. On the rare occasion that the customer chooses one of the firms of conveyancers who will also represent the Bank, the conveyancer will be able to act for both the customer and the Bank with the customer meeting the conveyancing costs of the whole transaction. The customer's conveyancer should not exchange contracts until authorised by the Bank's conveyancer to do so. Shared Equity (including Help to Buy) expandable section Lets your customer buy a home by sharing the equity with a third party. Local Authority, Housing Association or Government schemes are acceptable but we cannot accept applications on private shared equity schemes i.e. where the equity loan is provided by a Private Company, Developer or Builder. Halifax must have first charge. The seller secures their interest by way of a second charge. The following limits apply and the loan to full value of the property must not exceed normal lending limits: The equity share being purchased must be between 25% and 90%. The equity loan must be a minimum of 10%. Customer must always provide a minimum personal deposit of 5% based on the purchase price of the whole property. The mortgage must be a maximum of 85% LTV based on the purchase price of the whole property. Purchase price limits may differ

depending on the scheme. For Help to Buy Wales, the maximum property value from 01/04/2023 is £300,000. Please refer to the Welsh Government's scheme rules. The mortgage must be on a repayment basis. We do not allow any remortgage applications, where there is any element of debt consolidation. The term of the mortgage must be shorter than or equal to the equity loan term. We will apply an income multiple cap of four and a half times income on all affordable housing (shared equity and shared ownership) applications, including Help to Buy Equity Loans. Client must pay a 5% personal deposit (excluding any deposit provided by a builder or housing association). Cash incentives are acceptable provided the loan and cash incentive together do not exceed 95% of the value of the customer's equity share. If the customer is required to make interest payments for the equity loan this must be confirmed and the correct interest figure keyed for the application to proceed. The interest figure must be entered in ‘Monthly Interest Payments' field on the Schemes screen and not as a commitment under Credit Commitments. The interest charge must be keyed and taken into account in the affordability calculation even if interest is not payable from the start. For schemes with planned payment increases the higher figure should be keyed e.g. if in years 1-5 is 3% but increases to 5% from year 6, the 5% figure must be keyed. Only if the customer will never pay any interest should a zero figure be keyed. Example: 80/20 Shared Equity purchase Purchase Price = £100,000 Your customer's share = £80,000 Your customer deposit = £5,000 Mortgage required = £75,000 The maximum financial incentive which is permitted = £1,000 (95% of £80,000 = £76,000) Calculate equity loan interest payments as follows: Amount of equity retained by the builder/shared equity loan provider = £20,000 (20% of £100,000 full value) Rate of interest payable (confirmed by customer) = e.g. 4% £20,000 x 4% = £800 per annum £800 / 12 = £67 to be keyed in ‘Monthly interest payments’ field.

Shared Ownership expandable section Shared ownership allows a customer to buy a home in stages. The customer purchases a property jointly with either a Housing Association, also known as a Registered Social Landlord or a Local Authority. The customer will own a percentage of the property, with the remaining percentage being owned by the Housing Association/Local Authority. The terms of this arrangement is set out in a shared ownership lease. When a customer applies for a mortgage to buy a shared ownership property we are only lending on a specific percentage of the property value which means the customer will own a share of the property and pay rent to the Housing Association/Local Authority for the remaining share. Some shared ownership schemes may be aimed at members of the public such as key workers. Shared Ownership is only available where the share being purchased is between 20% and 85% of the property’s value for new build

For shared ownership the customer must pay a 5% personal deposit of the share being purchased (minimum £4,000 and excluding any deposit provided by a builder or housing association). Product fees cannot be added above 95%. Cash Incentives for shared ownership are acceptable provided the total value of the loan plus incentive plus any product fee being added together does not exceed 95% of the value of the share being purchased. Shared ownership mortgages must be held on a repayment basis and affordability will be capped at 4.49 times income. Proof of the rental payment to be made will be required on all shared ownership scheme applications: Purchase Application Key Information Document Memorandum of Sale Authority to Proceed Remortgage Application Key Information Document Memorandum of Sale Authority to Proceed Annual Landlord Rent Review letter Further Advance and Product Transfer Applications Annual Landlord Rent Review letter A Mortgage Protection Clause (provided by a Housing Association) /Section 442 Guarantee (provided by a Local Authority) is a form of indemnity insurance to protect the bank against loss (should the customer default on their payments and the bank make a loss selling the property in possession).

These will fall into one of the following categories: Newly built property Refurbished property i.e. refurbishment of an existing residential property, typically a re-furbished property will be considered as initial occupancy where the vendor is a builder/developer and the property has been vacated to allow for the refurbishment to be undertaken Newly converted property i.e. conversion of an existing non-residential property, e.g. an existing mill converted into flats A property, either new or converted (as above), that has been tenanted and is now offered for sale by the builder/developer.

Where this cannot be obtained this EWS1 and Cladding criteria applies. Modern Methods of Construction The term Modern Methods of Construction can be described as a range of processes and technologies which involve prefabrication, off-site assembly and various forms of supply chain specifications carried out when constructing a property. This differs with other “traditional” building methods such as load bearing brick, block and masonry construction. We are happy to consider Modern Methods of Construction within standard policy subject to the following requirements. The valuer will assess the suitability of the construction type for lending purposes and may require the

How does it affect my mortgage affordability? Along with various other factors, including your income and outgoings, we take into account the EPC of a property when determining how much you can borrow. You might receive a higher loan amount if the EPC is an A or B rating. You might receive a slightly lower loan amount if the rating is F or G.

We may ask a surveyor to carry out an internal inspection or Remote Valuation using property details, previous sale/valuation prices and local area knowledge without visiting the property. Or we may use an Automated Valuation (AVM), a combination of historical and market data to compare the property to others in the local area. A report will only be available if a surveyor visits the property. If a physical inspection takes place this will be based on a limited inspection and defects that could affect your client’s decision to buy may not be identified. It should not be relied on for their buying decision. There is not the option to choose the type of Level 1 valuation carried out. It is important the client is aware of the different valuation types and limitations of each. HomePlus Survey (Level 2) - this gives a more detailed analysis of the property’s condition and defects, and a comprehensive digital report for your client. We only receive and make our lending decisions on the valuation. We do not offer a Building Survey (Level 3), the information provided below is for guidance only. If your client would like a building survey please refer to the RICS website to locate a local surveyor. The client will still need to pay us for a Level 1 Mortgage Valuation which is for lending purposes only. The level of detail which a surveyor will include in a valuation or survey report, depends on the type of report being carried out. The table shows you what would be included in a typical report. The valuation instruction may be passed to the surveyors as soon as an application is submitted and the valuation fee is non-refundable once the property assessment has been carried

out. A mortgage valuation is valid for 12 months. If a mortgage does not complete within 12 months of the valuation being carried out then a new valuation will be needed, and a new fee potentially needs to be collected. We will advise you at the time if a new valuation fee is needed. See our Valuations criteria section. Other application types Remortgages - there is no valuation or survey, we carry out an assessment of the property at no charge to your client. Further advances (including combined product transfer/further advance applications) - if the total loan (existing mortgage plus further advance) exceeds more than 80% loan to value of the indexed valuation a revaluation is needed for the case to proceed. If your client wishes to proceed and feels that the property value is higher and sufficient that the total lending will be within the maximum 85% limit, they may give an estimated property value. A revaluation will be needed to support the estimated property value being used for which a revaluation fee of £100 will be charged and must be paid in advance by the client before a valuer can be instructed. The revaluation is for lender purposes only and may be completed using an automated valuation or remote valuation.

Valuation appeal process expandable section Following your feedback we have made an improvement to the process for intermediary customers appealing valuations on the property they are purchasing or remortgaging. Please note that an appeal on a remortgage can only be considered where the valuation figure has materially affected your customer’s application and the valuer has not physically visited your customer’s property as part of their remortgage application. A material affect is where the required loan amount is no longer achievable or where the new LTV affects the chosen product. If you need to appeal a valuation you should fully complete the valuation appeals form (PDF, 66kB). Incomplete forms cannot be considered for an appeal and will be automatically returned. To allow us to consider the appeal, please send the following information and/or documentation: Evidence of three comparable property sales, ideally within the last six months. This should include the sales figure, date of completion, full address of the properties, name of the

estate agents that sold the properties and details of how the properties compare with the subject property in terms of size, age, condition and the distance from that subject property must be provided. The evidence for the comparable property should include confirmation of the sale price and date of sale from the estate agents. It is not acceptable for an estate agent to provide an estimated asking price if the property were to be put on the market for sale. We will not accept the use of a customer's own valuation (prepared by another valuer) in place of our valuation. For new build properties, any evidence provided must be directly comparable and where 'incentives' have been provided by the house builder, these should be clearly documented. Where available provide a web site link to each comparable. For remortgage properties, details of any improvements or alterations made to the property since it was purchased by your customer (e.g. extension, conservatory, loft conversion) that may have positively affected the value. The form and supporting documentation should be emailed to ValuationAppeals@lloydsbanking.com You are responsible for gathering and preparing the required documentation. If the required information is not provided, the appeal will be returned and you will be asked to resubmit it. The outcome of the appeal will be communicated to you by email.

Valuation appeal process expandable section Following your feedback we have made an improvement to the process for intermediary customers appealing valuations on the property they are purchasing or remortgaging. Please note that an appeal on a remortgage can only be considered where the valuation figure has materially affected your customer’s application and the valuer has not physically visited your customer’s property as part of their remortgage application. A material affect is where the required loan amount is no longer achievable or where the new LTV affects the chosen product. If you need to appeal a valuation you should fully complete the valuation appeals form (PDF, 66kB). Incomplete forms cannot be considered for an appeal and will be automatically returned. To allow us to consider the appeal, please send the following information and/or documentation: Evidence of three comparable property sales, ideally within the last six months. This should include the sales figure, date of completion, full address of the properties, name of the

estate agents that sold the properties and details of how the properties compare with the subject property in terms of size, age, condition and the distance from that subject property must be provided. The evidence for the comparable property should include confirmation of the sale price and date of sale from the estate agents. It is not acceptable for an estate agent to provide an estimated asking price if the property were to be put on the market for sale. We will not accept the use of a customer's own valuation (prepared by another valuer) in place of our valuation. For new build properties, any evidence provided must be directly comparable and where 'incentives' have been provided by the house builder, these should be clearly documented. Where available provide a web site link to each comparable. For remortgage properties, details of any improvements or alterations made to the property since it was purchased by your customer (e.g. extension, conservatory, loft conversion) that may have positively affected the value. The form and supporting documentation should be emailed to ValuationAppeals@lloydsbanking.com You are responsible for gathering and preparing the required documentation.

Once the further advance funds have been released the product transfer will take effect from the 1st of the following month. If early repayment charges currently apply a combined application can only be keyed inside the last 4 months of the existing product. If you apply in the 4th month before the end of the existing product the further advance funds will not be able to be requested until in the last month of the existing product, so the product transfer does not take effect until the existing product has ended. If you apply inside the last 3 months of the existing product the customer could choose to not request the further advance funds until in the last month of the existing product, so the product transfer does not take effect until the existing product has ended, but they have the option to request the further advance funds at any time inside the last 3 months and the product transfer will take effect from the 1st of the following month.

You are able to request a PT up until the end of the month to take effect from the following month, but if an application is made late in the month and we have any additional requirements or further actions are required we cannot guarantee the PT can take effect from the following month. If a PT is completed in the last few days of a month it may not be possible to update the Direct Debit payment if this is collected early in the month ; the new payment would be collected from the following month.

Keying from 4 months the new rate will start after the end of the existing product. This means the new rate is secured in advance and the customer still benefits from the current rate until this ends. Keying within the last 3 months you can choose the date of effect, to start after the end of the existing product or to start from the 1st of the following month (e.g. if the customer was switching to a lower rate) and any Early Repayment Charge (ERC) would be waived. Where a mortgage is currently on standard variable rate the PT will take effect the following month. You are able to request a PT up until the end of the month to take effect from the following month, but if an application is made late in the month and we have any additional requirements or further actions are required we cannot guarantee the PT can take effect from the following month. If a PT is completed in the last few days of a month it may not be possible to update the Direct Debit payment if this is collected early in the month ; the new payment would be collected from the following month.

Amending or cancelling a PT expandable section If your customer no longer wishes to proceed with a PT this can be cancelled at any time before the PT has taken effect, but once a PT has taken effect this cannot be cancelled.

Only one application for a customer can be progressing at any one time. ‘Completion’ of a product transfer will take place in the month before the new rate takes effect; when a PT has been future dated completion will be early in the month before effect, and if keying a PT to start from the following month completion will take place shortly after the offer has been produced. The customer will receive their completion letter to confirm the exact new monthly payment a few days after completion. Pre-Completion On your My Applications page find the required PT tile and click the ‘Cancel’ button. You can then key a new PT application as normal. If the ‘Cancel’ button does not show this means the PT has already completed and a ‘Completed’ status will show on the My Applications page.

Any new PT application cannot be keyed until you receive confirmation the cancellation has been completed. Please be aware that if you request cancellation of a PT close to the end of the month, we will endeavour to complete the cancellation so that if required you have time to key a new PT before the end of the month, but we cannot guarantee the time the cancellation process will take if further actions are required.

If the full interest only amount is not covered by valid repayment plan(s): Complete the Repayment Vehicles screen with full details of any valid plans held even if they are insufficient to cover all interest only lending or ‘None’ if no acceptable repayment plans are held. The application will follow the full affordability process. You will need to key income and commitment details but there is no requirement to submit any verification documents. We will calculate if the customer could afford to transfer any amount to capital and interest repayment. If the customer cannot afford to transfer any amount to capital and interest repayment the PT can proceed with the mortgage remaining on an interest only basis. If the customer could afford to transfer all, or some, of the mortgage to capital and interest repayment it will be the customer’s choice if they choose to do so and the PT can proceed either way.

New build property explained expandable section An initial occupancy/new build property is classed as any property being occupied and/or sold for the first time on the open market in its current state and includes converted and refurbished properties. These will fall into one of the following categories: Newly built property Refurbished property i.e. refurbishment of an existing residential property, typically a re-furbished property will be considered as initial occupancy where the vendor is a builder/developer and the property has been vacated to allow for the refurbishment to be undertaken Newly converted property i.e. conversion of an existing non-residential property, e.g. an existing mill converted into flats A property, either new or converted (as above), that has been tenanted and is now offered for sale by the builder/developer. For properties classified as new build/initial occupancy, an appropriate building standards warranty e.g. NHBC or appropriate monitoring certificate provided by a suitably qualified consultant/architect will be required. EWS1 and Cladding For new build high rise blocks over 18m / 6 storeys in height (England & Wales) or 11m / 4 storeys in height (Scotland) Building Regulation compliance, The Building (Amendment) Regulations 2018 or local equivalent can be relied on, subject to the conveyancer receiving confirmation of this from the building owner, and/or its agent or duty holder. Where this cannot be obtained this EWS1 and Cladding criteria applies. Modern Methods of Construction The term Modern Methods of Construction can be described as a range of processes and technologies which involve prefabrication, off-site assembly and various forms of supply chain specifications carried out when constructing a property. This differs with other “traditional” building methods such as load bearing brick, block and masonry construction. We are happy to consider Modern Methods of Construction within standard policy subject to the following requirements. The valuer will assess the suitability of the construction type for lending purposes and may require the conveyancer to confirm the existence of one or more of the following: Build Offsite Property Assurance Scheme approval (A suitable warranty is needed in addition) NHBC Accepts approval (a suitable warranty is needed in addition) LPS2020 (although no longer being provided) or a UK Agreement certificate for the system as a whole 60 year minimum design life at point of completion assessment, tested by a British accredited body i.e. British Board of Agreement (BBA) / Building Research Establishment (BRE).

The law says we must have one or more of these reasons: To fulfil a contract we have with you, or When it is our legal duty, or When it is in our legitimate interest, or When you consent to it, or When it is in the public interest. When we have a business or commercial reason of our own to use your personal information, this is called a ‘legitimate interest’. We’ll tell you what that is, if we are going to rely on it as the reason for using your personal information. Even then, it must not unfairly go against your interests. You have the right to object to use of your personal information in this way. You can do this by telling us anything that we may need to consider, to understand if our use of your personal information is fair. Please see the ‘Your data privacy rights’ section for more information. The law and other

This might be a store or car dealership that offers finance deals through us, or a price comparison website. Market researchers. These firms may get in touch with you on our behalf to ask you for your opinions and feedback. Sometimes these firms will combine what you tell them with data from other sources to study it. They'll use this to help us understand our customers’ point of view, so we can improve the way we work as a business. Organisations that complete analysis and produce market insights on our behalf. Advisers who help us to come up with new ways of doing business. This might be a legal firm, IT supplier or consultancy. Advertisers and technology providers that you use, such as websites you visit, social media, and providers of apps and smart devices. This is so that: You are only shown marketing we think you might be interested in. You are not shown marketing we think you won’t be interested in. We can try to find new customers who are like you, or have similar interests to yours. Learn more about how we use your information to make automated decisions. Outside organisations you may use. This could include: Price comparison websites and similar organisations. We only do this if you use such a company to apply for our products or services. We only share details needed to confirm what you have applied for, or taken out, to fulfil our contract with the company. Third party payment providers. For example if you use an App on your phone to pay for something, then we may share payment and transaction data with them. This includes the amount, type, location, origin and recipients. Organisations that provide professional services. This includes legal professionals for example, where you are taking wills, powers of attorney or related estate planning services from one of our approved providers. Organisations outside Lloyds Banking Group that use our brands to provide products or services. If you apply for one of these products, we may share information about you with these organisations. If we want to share information in this way, we, or the company will tell you before we do so. Company mergers, takeovers, financings and transfers of products or services We may also share your personal information if the ownership of products or services or the make-up of Lloyds Banking Group changes in the future: We may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business, or our assets, including products or services. Or

--- CHUNK 12 ---
we may try to bring other businesses into Lloyds Banking Group. This is sometimes called Mergers and Acquisitions or ‘company takeovers’. During any such process, we may share your data with other parties involved. We’ll only do this if they agree to keep your data safe and private. If the change to our Group happens, then other parties may use your data in the same way as set out in this notice. Sharing information that doesn’t reveal your identity We may share or sell some information to other organisations outside Lloyds Banking Group, but only when we have removed any personal details, so that no-one’s identity can be known or found out. We and those other organisations do this to help them learn about the types of customers they have, how customers use their products, and how their products perform. It also helps us to learn about the markets we each operate in and how our competitors perform. The law says data is not considered to be personal information after customer identities have been removed. One of the ways we can share information without revealing customers' identities is by grouping customers' information together. Organisations can use this grouped customer information to look for general patterns and trends in the information, without knowing individual customer identities. For example, we might provide them with information about: types of customers in a specific location shopping for clothes customers that fall into a particular age group, or live in a particular area patterns of spending habits, such as the average amount spent in one month To create this information, we analyse all of the details we hold about you and other customers. This includes information about your current and past products and services you have with us. How we work out what marketing you receive This section tells you how we decide what marketing to show or send you. It also explains how we work out what you may be interested in. We may use your personal information to make decisions about what products, services and offers we think you may be interested in. This is what we mean when we talk about ‘marketing’. We may send you carefully selected messages on products and offers from ourselves, other companies within Lloyds Banking Group and selected third parties. When we can use your personal information for marketing We can only use your personal information to send you marketing messages if we have either your consent or a ‘legitimate interest’. That is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your personal information. It must not conflict unfairly with your own interests. How we decide what marketing may interest you The personal information we have for you is made up of what you tell us, and data we collect when you use our services, or from outside organisations we work with. We study this to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to

--- CHUNK 13 ---
you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you. We use the information to understand what kind of things you like, special events in your life, and how you react to different kinds of marketing material. This is called profiling for marketing purposes. It helps us to decide what products, services and offers we can promote to you. We may also conduct profiling for other purposes – please see 'Tailoring products and services' under 'How we use your information to make automated decisions' for further information. You can contact us at any time and ask us to stop using your personal information this way. Please see the ‘Your data privacy rights’ section for more information, and the ‘How to contact us’ section to contact us about this. How we send you marketing We may show or send you marketing material online (on our own and other websites including social media), in our own and other apps, or by email, mobile phone, post or through smart devices and other digital channels. Your marketing choices You can tell us to stop sending you marketing at any time. Whatever you choose, we’ll still send you statements and other important information such as changes to your existing products and services. You can also tell us not to collect your personal information for marketing purposes while you are using our websites or mobile apps. If you do, you may still see some marketing, but it may not be tailored to you. See our Cookie Policy for details about how we use this information to improve our websites and mobile apps. We may ask you to confirm or update your choices, if you take out any new products or services with us in the future. We’ll also ask you to do this if there are changes in the law, regulation or the structure of our business. If you change your mind, you can contact us to update your choices at any time. Please see the ‘Your data privacy rights’ section for more information, and the ‘How to contact us’ section to contact us about this. How we use your information to make automated decisions Here we tell you how we use automated systems to make decisions about you and your money. We also explain your right to challenge decisions made this way. We sometimes use systems to make automated decisions about you or your business. This helps us to make sure our decisions are quick, fair, efficient and correct, based on what we know. Automated decisions can affect the products, services or features we may offer you now or in the future, or the price we charge for them. They are based on personal information that we have or that we are allowed to collect from others. Some of our systems learn from this information to make sure our automated decisions stay accurate and fair. This is sometimes known as ‘artificial intelligence’ or ‘machine learning’. Here are the types

--- CHUNK 14 ---
of automated decisions we make: Pricing We may decide what to charge for some products and services based on what we know. For example, if you use our online mortgage calculator, it will use the personal financial details you put in to estimate the kind of mortgage we may offer you. If you apply for insurance, we’ll compare what you tell us with other records to work out how likely you are to make a claim. This will help us to decide whether to offer you the product and what price to charge you. Tailoring products and services The personal information we have for you is made up of what you tell us, and information we collect when you use our services, or from outside organisations we work with. We study this to form a view on what we think you may do, want, or need. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you. Profiling for other non-marketing purposes Sometimes we use your personal information to create a profile about you, for purposes other than marketing or making automated decisions about you. This means we build up a picture over time of your tastes, and things we think you may need, want or do based on how you interact with us. This may be changed into a ‘score’ or number we add to your record with us. We use this information to place you in groups with similar customers. These are called customer segments. We use these to study and learn about our customers’ needs. It helps us to design different products, services and offers for different customer segments, and to manage our relationships with them. It also helps us tailor what individuals see on our own and other websites and mobile apps, including social media. We also use customer segments from outside organisations we work with, such as social media. We ask them for groups of people who are like you, or have interests that are like yours in some ways. These organisations help us look for new customers who may be interested in products, services or offers that our existing customers are interested in. You can ask us to stop using your information in this way. Please see the ‘Your data privacy rights’ section, and the 'How to contact us’ section for details about how to do this. Detecting fraud We use your personal information to help decide if your personal or business accounts may be being used for fraud or money-laundering. We may detect that an account is being used in ways that fraudsters work. Or we may notice that an account is being used in a way that is unusual for you or your business. If we think there is a risk of fraud, we may stop activity on the accounts or refuse access to them. Opening accounts When you open an account with us, we check that the product or service is relevant for you, based on what

--- CHUNK 15 ---
we know. We also check that you or your business meet the conditions needed to open the account. This may include checking age, residency, nationality or financial position. It may mean we can't offer you the account you want. Approving credit We use a system to decide whether to lend money to you or your business, when you apply for credit such as a loan or credit card. This is called credit scoring. It uses past data to assess how you’re likely to act while paying back any money you borrow. This includes data about similar accounts you may have had before. Credit scoring uses data from three sources: Your application form Credit reference agencies Data we may already hold. It gives an overall assessment based on this. Banks and other lenders use this to help us make responsible lending decisions that are fair and informed. Credit scoring methods are tested regularly to make sure they are fair and unbiased. This credit score can determine whether we’ll give you credit or allow you to take another product or service. Your rights You can object to an automated decision we have made and ask that a person reviews it. If you want to know more about these rights, please see the ‘Your data privacy rights’ section for more information, and the ‘How to contact us’ section to contact us about this. Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs) This section explains how we work with outside organisations to decide whether to lend you money through products like credit cards or loans. It also explains how we manage our products during your relationship with us. It explains what we do and why we do it. We carry out credit and identity checks when you apply for a product or services for you or your business. We may use Credit Reference Agencies to help us with this. We’ll go on sharing your personal information with CRAs during your relationship with us. From time to time, we may also search information that the CRAs have to help us manage your accounts. We’ll share your personal information with CRAs and they’ll give us information about you. The data we exchange can include: Name, address and date of birth Credit application Details of any shared credit Financial situation and history Fraud prevention information We’ll use this data to: Assess whether you or your business is able to afford to make repayments Make sure what you’ve told us is true, correct and up to date Help detect and prevent financial crime Manage your accounts with us Trace and recover debts Make sure any offers are relevant for you. This will include details of money going into the account, and the account balance. If you borrow, it will also include details of your repayments, and whether you repay in full and on time. We’ll also tell the CRAs when you settle your accounts with us. The CRAs may give this information to other organisations that want to check your credit status.

--- CHUNK 16 ---
When we ask CRAs about you or your business, they’ll note it on your credit file. This is called a credit search. Other lenders may see this and we may see credit searches from other lenders. If you apply for a product with someone else, we’ll link your records with theirs. We'll do the same if you tell us you have a spouse, partner or civil partner – or that you are in business with other partners or directors. You should tell them about this before you apply for a product or service. It's important that they know your records will be linked together, and that credit searches may be made on them. CRAs will also link your records together. These links will stay on your files unless one of you asks the CRAs to break the link. You'll normally need to give proof that you no longer have a financial link with each other. You can find out more about the CRAs on their websites, in the Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (CRAIN). This includes details about: Who they are Their role as fraud prevention agencies The data they hold and how they use it How they share personal information How long they can keep data Your data protection rights. Here are links to the information notice for each of the three main Credit Reference Agencies: TransUnion Equifax Experian We use these agencies mainly with UK, Isle of Man or EEA products and customers. For non-UK, Isle of Man or EEA products and customers, we may not use these agencies. We may instead use other regional CRAs. Please see the ‘How to contact us’ section if you’d like to speak to us about this. Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPAs) This section deals with information we share outside our group to help fight financial crime. This includes crimes such as fraud, money-laundering and terrorist financing. We may need to confirm your identity before we provide products or services to you or your business. This may include carrying out fraud checks at the point of sale. Once you have become a customer of ours, we’ll share your personal information as needed to help combat fraud and other financial crime. The organisations we share data with are: Registered Fraud Prevention Agencies Other agencies and bodies acting for the same purpose Industry databases used for this purpose Insurers Throughout our relationship with you, we and these organisations exchange data to help prevent, deter, detect and investigate fraud and money-laundering. We and these organisations can't use your personal information unless we have a proper reason to do so. It must be needed either for us to obey the law, or for a ‘legitimate interest’. When we have a business or commercial reason of our own to use your personal information, this is called a ‘legitimate interest’. We’ll tell you what that is, if we are going to rely on it as the reason for using your personal information. Even then, it must not unfairly go

--- CHUNK 17 ---
against your interests. We’ll use the personal information to: Confirm identities Help prevent fraud and/or money-laundering Fulfil any contracts you or your business has with us. We or an FPA may allow law enforcement agencies to access your personal information. This is to support their duty to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute crime. These other organisations can keep personal information for different lengths of time, up to six years. The information we use These are some of the kinds of personal information that we use: Name Date of birth Residential address History of where you have lived Contact details, such as email addresses and phone numbers Financial data Whether you have been a victim of fraud Data about insurance claims you have made Data about you or your businesses products or services Employment details Vehicle details Data that identifies the computers or other devices you use to connect to the internet. This includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address. Automated decisions for fraud prevention The information we have for you or your business is made up of what you tell us, and data we collect when you use our services, or from third parties we work with. We and other organisations acting to prevent fraud may process your personal information in systems that look for fraud by studying patterns in the data. We may find that an account or policy is being used in ways that fraudsters work. Or we may notice that an account is being used in a way that is unusual for you or your business. Either of these could indicate a risk of fraud or money-laundering against a customer, the bank or the insurer. How this can affect you If we or an FPA decide there is a risk of fraud, we may stop activity on the accounts or block access to them. FPAs and cross-industry organisations may also keep a record of the risks that you or your business may pose. This may result in other organisations refusing to provide you with products or services, or to employ you. Data transfers out of the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and EEA FPAs and other organisations we share data with for these purposes may send personal information to countries outside the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and European Economic Area (‘EEA’). This may include countries where the UK Government has decided that your data will be protected to UK standards. If the data is sent to another type of country, the FPAs or other organisations will make sure your data stays protected to the same standard as the EEA by making sure appropriate safeguards are in place. This may include following international frameworks for making data sharing secure. The main Fraud Prevention Agency we use, CIFAS, has published more information about data transfers: CIFAS Sending data outside the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and EEA This section tells you about the safeguards that keep your personal information safe and private, if it is sent

--- CHUNK 18 ---
outside the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and EEA. We’ll only send your data outside of the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and European Economic Area (‘EEA’) to: Follow your instructions. For example, if you book a hotel in Australia with your Lloyds Banking Group card, we’ll send the details necessary to fulfil that payment to the hotel’s bank. Comply with a legal duty. For example, we share information about US citizens with the US tax authority. Work with our suppliers who help us to run your accounts and services. If we do transfer your personal information outside the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and EEA to our suppliers, we’ll make sure it’s protected to the same extent as in the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and EEA. We’ll use one of these safeguards: Transfer it to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and EEA. Learn more on the Rules on international data transfer on the European Commission Justice website. Put in place a contract with the recipient that means they must protect it to the same standards as the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands and EEA. Read more about this on the Digital privacy on the European Commission Justice website.

If we do restrict your personal information in this way, we won’t use or share it in other ways while it is restricted. This means that we may not be able to provide you some of your products or services while the restriction is in place. Please see the ‘How to contact us’ section to do this. The right to data portability You have the right to get certain personal information from us as a digital file. This means you can keep and use it yourself and give it to other organisations if you choose to.

Please see the ‘How to contact us’ section if you want to object to us using your information. Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling You have rights around automated decision making and profiling.

To keep up to date on online security issues, please visit www.banksafeonline.org.uk. Our guarantee If a Halifax customer is a victim of fraud involving the Internet, we will guarantee that they will not lose any money as a result of the fraud, and we will reimburse them in full. How is my information kept secure on the internet? The best way to ensure online security is to use the most recent version of a recommended Internet browser which offers the latest encryption technology. Currently the latest versions of Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer offer this technology. What is encryption? Encryption is a way of coding information to make it virtually impossible for someone else to read, unless they have the ‘key’ to decipher it. The effectiveness of encryption is measured in bits (binary digits). The latest web browsers available from Microsoft and Firefox offer 128-bit encryption technology. Halifax cannot be used without 128-bit encryption - for your security and peace of mind. What does Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) mean? SSL provides a secure communications link between your browser and Halifax. All information passed back and forth is encrypted. SSL is now supported by all major browsers and is generally accepted as a way of doing business securely over the internet. How should I protect my security details? Never write them down Never share them with anyone else Never include them in an email Keep your password secure: Create a strong password. An easy way to create a strong password is to combine three completely unrelated words, replace some letters with numbers and include a mixture of upper & lower case, for example: Radio, Marmalade and Sunny together make Radi0marmalad3Sunny. (But obviously, don’t use this specific example). Don’t use anything obvious. Don’t use your user name or personal details. Don’t use your child or pet’s name, birthdays, email address or anything else that can easily be guessed. Don’t recycle passwords. Like going from password2 to password3. In addition, Never leave your PC unattended when logged in placing business, especially without a screen lock. We recommend that you log out if you leave your PC unattended. When logging in, make sure that no-one can see what you're typing. Always log out and close your browser when you have finished placing business. Never respond to emails that request you to reply with your security details, including those that appear to be from Halifax. Remember that protecting your User ID, password and memorable information is your responsibility. Security certificate When entering secure websites you should always check the security certificate and look out for warning messages. Double-clicking the padlock symbol

--- CHUNK 2 ---
displayed on your browser will tell you the level of security being used. However, changes to the technology used by VeriSign, the issuer of our website security certificate, means that older versions of Internet Explorer (version 4 and older versions of IE5) are unable to read updated certificates. An alert may appear suggesting that our security certificate is not valid - this is not true. If you choose to 'OK' the alert you will still be able to proceed and use the online banking service as normal. If you are getting this security alert then we suggest you update your browser to version IE6 or later to correct this problem. If you'd like to update your browser you can visit the Microsoft Internet Explorer homepage. (Please note Halifax is not responsible for the content of external websites.) How can I help prevent someone else finding out my details? When visiting the Halifax website always complete your task before leaving the site. Never leave your computer unattended while you are on the internet, especially when you are logged in. Always log out before leaving the site. How can I protect myself from computer viruses?

Email Tracking or similar tracking technologies This section explains more about the technologies we use to ­review how you interact with emails we send you. It explains why we do this, and how you can stop it. We review how you interact with emails we send you by using small images that you cannot see called ‘pixels’ within our emails. These pixels allow us to capture some information about emails we’ve sent you, such as: When you opened the email, How many times you opened it, and The device you used to open it. This is called ‘email tracking’. We use this information to help us understand how effective our emails are, and to improve our communications with you. The pixel stays in the email, but leaves nothing else on your device. How to stop Email Tracking You can stop this by: Closing the email before you download any images. Setting your browser or email program to restrict or block our emails. Sometimes your browser or email program setting will automatically download images. For more details on this, you’ll need to read the instructions for your browser, email program or device. How to stop Email Tracking for marketing purposes You can stop this by: Opting out from marketing emails by reviewing your marketing choices. You can review your marketing choices in a few ways. Use your internet or mobile banking applications, visit one of our branches, or see the ‘How to contact us’ section in our Data Privacy Notice to speak to us about this. Email Link Tracking When we send you emails including links to our web pages, we track the Lloyds Banking Group web pages you visit when using those links. We’ll only do this if you accept Marketing Cookies when you enter our site. We do not track any other non-Lloyds Banking Group sites you may also visit.
